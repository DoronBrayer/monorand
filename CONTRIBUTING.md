# Contributing to `shuffrand`
Hey there, future `shuffrand` contributor! We're thrilled you're considering lending your expertise to this project. `shuffrand` isn't just a library; it's a testament to meticulous craftsmanship and an unwavering pursuit of quality in the realm of secure randomness. Our "soul-infused" approach means we deeply value thoughtful, high-quality contributions that align with our core philosophies: ESM-first, TypeScript-native, and a relentless focus on robustness. If you share this passion for building truly dependable utilities, you're in the right place!

Before you dive in, please take a moment to familiarize yourself with our development practices. All contributions must adhere to `shuffrand`'s architectural purity: think ESM-first, TypeScript-native code, and our unique flat, dot-categorized file structure. Crucially, we maintain strict code quality standards, so always run `pnpm run format` (we love 4-space indentation and a slight dislike for semicolons!) and `pnpm run lint` before committing. Our "test the final product" philosophy means your changes should be thoroughly validated by running `pnpm test --run` against the dist/ directory, ensuring that what you're shipping is exactly what's tested. Adding new, comprehensive tests for any new features or bug fixes is absolutely paramount.

Ready to make your mark? Here's the general flow: fork the repository, clone it locally, create a new branch for your feature or fix, make your changes adhering to the guidelines above, write descriptive commit messages (e.g., `feat(cryptoString): Add new character set option`), push your branch, and then open a pull request. We're aiming for a small, dedicated core team (myself plus three highly capable and passionate strangers), so every contribution is significant and will be reviewed with care. Your efforts will directly shape the future of `shuffrand` as a foundational engine for secure applications.

Finally, please remember to review our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/DoronBrayer/shuffrand/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). It outlines the respectful and constructive environment we strive to maintain. If you have any questions or need clarification on anything, don't hesitate to open an issue or reach out. We're excited to collaborate with you on building an even more indispensable `shuffrand`!
