Migrating from ESLint+Prettier to Biome — recommended?

---

# ROUND A
## 🤖 Gemini
Migrating from ESLint and Prettier to Biome is a viable option, particularly for projects that prioritize performance and simplicity. Biome combines a linter, formatter, and other tools into a single, high-performance binary, which often results in a significant speed boost compared to the traditional ESLint and Prettier setup.

### Advantages of Migrating to Biome
* **Performance:** Biome is written in Rust and is multi-threaded, making it considerably faster than both ESLint and Prettier. It is claimed to be up to **25x faster than Prettier** and **15x faster than ESLint**.
* **Simplicity:** Biome has a single configuration file (`biome.json`), which simplifies setup and maintenance. This is a major improvement over managing multiple configuration files and plugins for ESLint and Prettier. It is also designed to be easy to get started with, often requiring minimal configuration out of the box.
* **One-Stop Solution:** It unifies the functions of formatting, linting, and even import organization into a single tool, reducing the number of dependencies in your project.
* **Migration Tools:** Biome provides built-in `migrate` commands (`biome migrate eslint --write` and `biome migrate prettier --write`) that automate the process of converting your existing configurations, making the switch much more straightforward than it used to be.

### Considerations Before Migrating
* **Customization:** While Biome has a comprehensive set of rules, it is not as customizable as ESLint. If your project relies on many specialized ESLint plugins or very specific custom rules, you may find that Biome lacks a direct equivalent.
* **Ecosystem:** The ESLint and Prettier ecosystem is vast and mature, with a massive number of plugins for various frameworks and libraries (e.g., Cypress, JSX a11y). Biome is still a younger tool, and its ecosystem is not as extensive.
* **Breaking Changes:** Biome is under active development, and while the team strives for stability, there can be minor breaking changes in new versions. Locking the version in your `package.json` can help mitigate this.

Ultimately, migrating to Biome is recommended if your primary concerns are build speed, reducing configuration complexity, and managing a single toolchain. It is a compelling choice for modern web projects, especially monorepos, but teams with highly customized or legacy setups may find the transition more challenging.

## 🤖 Claude
Based on current migration experiences and industry feedback, **yes, migrating to Biome is increasingly recommended for many projects in 2025**, but with some important considerations.

### The Case FOR Migration
#### Performance Benefits
Biome is 25x times faster than Prettier and 15x times faster than ESLint, which makes a significant difference in large codebases and CI/CD pipelines.

#### Simplified Toolchain
By combining these tools into a single solution, Biome minimizes the need for multiple configurations, thus creating a more seamless experience for developers. This means:
- One configuration file instead of multiple (`.eslintrc`, `.prettierrc`, etc.)
- One dependency instead of many
- Consistent behavior between formatting and linting
- First-class support for TypeScript and JSX

#### Migration Support
Biome provides dedicated commands to ease the migration from ESLint and Prettier, making the transition relatively straightforward.

### Success Stories
Recent migration experiences show positive results. It was a rather smooth migration according to developers who have made the switch, and The Biome CLI makes it easy to migrate from ESLint to Biome.

### Important Considerations
#### Rule Coverage Limitations
While Biome aims to be an easy replacement for Prettier and ESLint by being compatible with most of the rules, it will not implement all of them in the long run. This means:
- Some specialized ESLint plugins may not have Biome equivalents
- Custom rules might need workarounds
- Complex configurations may require simplification

#### Project Size Considerations
My side projects aren't big projects. Biome offers a way to migrate big project. We're speaking of that in my company but for now we keep Eslint - suggesting that while Biome works well for smaller projects, larger organizations are still evaluating the migration.

### My Recommendation
**Migrate if you:**
- Have a TypeScript/JavaScript project without heavy ESLint plugin dependencies
- Want simplified tooling and faster build times
- Are starting a new project or can afford some rule adjustments
- Value unified configuration over maximum customization

**Stick with ESLint + Prettier if you:**
- Heavily rely on specific ESLint plugins (like accessibility, security, or framework-specific rules)
- Have complex custom linting rules
- Work in a large organization that isn't ready to retrain teams
- Need maximum ecosystem compatibility

### Migration Strategy
If you decide to migrate:
1. **Start with a test branch** - try the migration on a copy
2. **Use Biome's migration commands** - they handle most of the heavy lifting
3. **Audit your current ESLint rules** - identify which ones are critical
4. **Plan for manual adjustments** - some rules may need workarounds
5. **Update CI/CD pipelines** - replace ESLint/Prettier commands with Biome

For your monorepo specifically, Biome's unified approach could significantly simplify your build process and reduce the complexity you're already dealing with in the Vite configuration issues.

The consensus in 2025 seems to be that Biome is ready for production use, especially for TypeScript projects, and the performance benefits alone make it worth considering for most modern JavaScript/TypeScript projects.

## 🤖 Grok
Biome is a modern, Rust-based toolchain that combines code formatting (replacing Prettier) and linting (replacing ESLint) into a single, high-performance tool. It's designed for JavaScript, TypeScript, JSX, and related ecosystems, with a focus on speed, simplicity, and minimal configuration. Originally stemming from the Rome project, Biome has matured significantly by mid-2025, offering migration commands like `biome migrate eslint` and `biome migrate prettier` to ease the transition from your current setup.

### Pros and Cons of Migrating
Based on recent developer experiences, benchmarks, and tool comparisons, here's a breakdown:
| Aspect              | Pros of Biome                                                                 | Cons of Biome                                                                 |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Performance**    | Up to 15-20x faster than ESLint + Prettier combos due to Rust's multi-threading and efficient parsing. For example, linting times drop from 18 seconds to 80ms or from 1 minute to 3 seconds in real-world monorepos. IDE feedback is near-instant, improving developer experience. | Minimal if your project is small and ESLint/Prettier are already optimized (e.g., via caching). |
| **Setup and Maintenance** | Unified tool reduces dependencies—no need for separate ESLint plugins, Prettier configs, or tools like lint-staged. Supports editor configs out-of-the-box and integrates well with VS Code/Neovim. Migration is straightforward with built-in commands. | Requires updating CI scripts, Husky hooks, or IDE extensions. Some teams report initial tweaks for full compatibility. |
| **Compatibility and Features** | 97% compatible with Prettier formatting and covers most popular ESLint rules (e.g., React-specific). Supports Astro, Svelte, Vue partially, and adds extras like `biome explain` for rule docs. Type-aware linting is in progress. | Doesn't implement *all* ESLint rules (e.g., some niche or custom plugins), and formatter support for non-JS formats like CSS, YAML, or Markdown is still limited or experimental as of v2—may require keeping Prettier for those. Import sorting had bugs in v1 but is improved in v2. |
| **Community and Maturity** | Growing adoption (e.g., at Vercel, where it sped up linting by 35-60% while replacing parts of ESLint/Prettier). Stable for production in 2025, with active updates and Discord community support. | Smaller ecosystem than ESLint's vast plugins. Some developers switch back for ESLint's flexibility if they rely on specific rules or have complex setups. |
| **Other**          | Free, open-source, and focuses on modern frontend (e.g., full React support). Can run alongside ESLint/Prettier for hybrid migration. | Potential regrets if your project uses Tailwind CSS heavily or needs advanced glob patterns (though Prettier has its own quirks here). |

### Is It Recommended?
Yes, migrating is generally recommended in 2025 for most JavaScript/TypeScript projects, especially if:
- Performance is a bottleneck (e.g., large monorepos or slow IDE linting).
- You want a simpler, all-in-one setup without managing multiple tools.
- Your codebase sticks to standard JS/TS/JSX without heavy reliance on obscure ESLint plugins or non-supported formats.

Developers report smooth migrations taking just a day, with significant speed gains and happiness afterward. For new projects, start with Biome directly—it's a "no-brainer" replacement for Prettier and promising for linting.

However, it's not a blanket yes:
- Test first: Run the migration commands on a branch and check for discrepancies (e.g., via `biome check`). If you need full ESLint rule parity or broader format support, stick with your current stack or use a hybrid approach.
- Alternatives like Oxlint (for linting only) could be faster in some cases but lack Biome's integrated formatting.

If your project is stable and fast enough with ESLint + Prettier, the switch might not be worth the effort unless you're chasing optimizations. For guidance, check Biome's official migration docs.

## 🤖 Qwen
**Yes, migrating to Biome is generally recommended as a strategic move for modern JavaScript/TypeScript projects, and the knowledge base supports this.**

**Here's my reasoning:**
1.  **Project Doctrine Aligns:** Your own `DOCTRINE.md` explicitly states that ESLint and Prettier are "**to be replaced**" and lists **Biome** as a "Solid Alternative" for both. This means the project's foundational principles already endorse this direction.
2.  **Performance Benefits:** Biome is widely recognized for being significantly faster than the traditional ESLint+Prettier combo because it's written in Rust. This leads to a better developer experience, especially in larger codebases or during pre-commit hooks/CI.
3.  **Unified Tooling:** Using one tool (Biome) instead of two (ESLint + Prettier) simplifies configuration, reduces potential conflicts between linter and formatter rules, and decreases the number of dependencies and devDependencies in your project. This aligns with the general principle of reducing complexity.
4.  **Feature Set:** Biome offers integrated linting, formatting, and even import sorting out-of-the-box. It covers the core functionalities of both ESLint and Prettier and often provides sensible defaults.
5.  **Modern Ecosystem Fit:** As of 2025, Biome has gained significant traction and is considered a modern, viable alternative. Adopting it keeps your toolchain contemporary.

**Potential Considerations (Why "Generally" Recommended):**
*   **Ecosystem Maturity (Relative to ESLint):** While rapidly maturing, ESLint has an absolutely enormous ecosystem of plugins for highly specific linting rules. If your project (or future projects in the monorepo) relies on very niche ESLint plugins with no Biome equivalent, migration might require finding workarounds or accepting the loss of those specific rules.
*   **Configuration Migration:** Moving existing ESLint and Prettier configurations to Biome requires effort, although Biome provides tools to help with this.

**Conclusion:**
Given that your project's own doctrine (`DOCTRINE.md`) already identifies this migration as the future direction, and considering Biome's advantages in performance, simplicity, and ecosystem trends, **I think migrating from ESLint+Prettier to Biome is a recommended step** for your `monorand` monorepo. It aligns with your documented intentions and moves the project towards a more modern, efficient, and unified development toolchain.

## 🤖 DeepSeek
Migrating from ESLint + Prettier to **Biome** (formerly Rome) is generally **recommended for most projects**, but requires careful consideration of your specific needs. Here's a balanced analysis:

### ✅ Advantages of Migrating
1. **Performance Boost**  
   Biome is written in Rust and typically runs **10–100x faster** than ESLint/Prettier JavaScript-based tools. A full lint+format on a large codebase might drop from minutes to seconds.
2. **Unified Toolchain**  
   Single configuration (`biome.json`) replaces:
   - ESLint config (`.eslintrc`)
   - Prettier config (`.prettierrc`)
   - Lint ignore files (`.eslintignore`)
3. **Modern Features**  
   - Built-in **import/export organization**
   - **Automatic safe fixes** (via `biome check --apply`)
   - **TypeScript-aware** without extra plugins
   - Unified **VS Code extension**
4. **Simpler Maintenance**  
   Eliminates dependency conflicts between:
   ```mermaid
   graph LR
   A[ESLint] --> B[Prettier]
   A --> C[TypeScript ESLint]
   A --> D[eslint-plugin-import]
   A --> E[...other plugins]
   ```

### ⚠️ Potential Challenges
1. **Rule Parity**  
   Some niche ESLint rules (especially plugin-based ones) may lack equivalents:
   - Custom plugin rules
   - Framework-specific rules (e.g., `eslint-plugin-react-hooks`)
   - **Workaround**: Use `biome.json`'s `"ignoredRules"` to disable unsupported rules incrementally
2. **Config Migration**  
   Complex ESLint setups (50+ rules) require manual translation to Biome's [configuration schema](https://biomejs.dev/reference/configuration).
3. **CI/CD Pipeline Changes**  
   Requires rewriting lint/format scripts and potentially updating Docker images.

### 📊 Migration Recommendation Table
| **Project Type**       | **Recommendation** | **Notes** |
|------------------------|--------------------|-----------|
| Greenfield projects    | ✅ Strong Yes      | Start with Biome default config |

   ```
3. **Run Parallel Analysis**  
   ```bash
   npx @biomejs/biome check --apply-unsafe  # Safe fixes
   npx @biomejs/biome check --dry  # Identify remaining issues
   ```
4. **Hybrid Approach (Optional)**  
   Keep Prettier temporarily while using Biome for linting:
   ```json
   // biome.json
   {
     "formatter": { "enabled": false },
     "linter": { "enabled": true }
   }
   ```
5. **Update Scripts**  
   Replace existing lint/format scripts:
   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "lint": "biome check ./src",
     "format": "biome format --write ./src"
   }
   ```

### 💡 Pro Tips
1. Use `biome migrate eslint` to auto-convert simple ESLint configs
2. Enable **error suppression comments** during transition:
   ```json
   // biome.json
   {
     "linter": { 
       "ignore": ["suppressLint"] 
     }
   }
   ```
   ```js
   // biome-ignore suppressLint: Explanation here
   legacyCode();
   ```

3. Leverage **VS Code Biome extension** for real-time feedback during migration

### Verdict
**Recommended for:**  
- Most new projects  
- Teams valuing performance  
- Codebases using standard JS/TS patterns  

**Not recommended yet for:**  
- Projects requiring specific ESLint plugins without Biome equivalents  
- Teams with complex custom lint rules  

Biome is rapidly evolving (v1.7 as of 2025) and has reached sufficient maturity for most use cases. The performance gains alone often justify migration – especially in monorepos where tool speed significantly impacts developer experience.

## 🤖 Kimi (kimi.com/chat)
