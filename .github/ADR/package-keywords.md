That's a fair point. The difference in opinion often comes down to an outdated versus a modern understanding of how package registries work.

### The Old Way vs. The New Way

In the early days of package managers, search was simple. It was essentially a raw text search. More keywords meant more chances to appear in a search result. This is where the old advice comes from.

Today, registries like npm and GitHub have sophisticated search algorithms. They use **quality scoring**, which considers factors like download count, stars, and the overall professionalism of a package's metadata. Keyword stuffing is now seen as a sign of low quality. A search for a niche keyword like "D&D" or "roulette" will likely not even surface your package if it's buried in a list of 100+ other keywords.

The modern best practice for a professional, high-quality library is to be **laser-focused**. A concise list of 5-10 highly relevant keywords tells the registry's algorithm and, more importantly, other developers that your package is the definitive solution for those specific tasks. It boosts your relevance score for the keywords that matter most and projects a professional image.
