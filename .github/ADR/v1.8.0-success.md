Over the past several days, we've executed a comprehensive project to transform a single-package repository into a fully functional, production-ready monorepo. This involved a significant restructuring of the project's codebase, an overhaul of its development and deployment workflows, and a successful final publication of the new packages.


### Phase 1: From Single-Repo to Monorepo
The primary objective was to refactor the existing `shuffrand` project into a monorepository. This involved moving the original library into a dedicated subdirectory (`shuffrand/`) and creating a new, secondary library (`datrand/`) within the same project.

This approach was managed using **pnpm workspaces**, a feature of the pnpm package manager that allows multiple packages to share a single root repository and common dependencies. Key changes in this phase included:

* **Repository Structure:** We created a `pnpm-workspace.yaml` file at the root to define the new monorepo.
* **Package Management:** We established independent `package.json` files for both `shuffrand` and `datrand`, allowing them to manage their own scripts and dependencies while benefiting from the shared `pnpm` lockfile.

### Phase 2: Configuring Modern Tooling and Workflows
With the new structure in place, the next step was to configure the build, test, and deployment pipelines. This required updating numerous configuration files to ensure they worked seamlessly with the monorepo architecture.

* **Build and Test:** We configured `Vite` for efficient building and `Vitest` for running tests across both packages. We also created a unified **`pnpm run preflight`** command to run all formatting, linting, building, and testing checks with a single command.
* **Continuous Integration (CI):** We refined the `main.yml` GitHub Actions workflow to run the `preflight` script automatically on every push and pull request. This ensured that no broken code could be merged into the main branch.
* **Continuous Deployment (CD):** We developed a dedicated `publish.yml` GitHub Actions workflow. This workflow is the core of the new deployment process, as it is exclusively triggered by a new `git tag` to publish the updated packages to the npm registry. This provides a secure and automated way to manage new releases.


### Phase 3: The Final Publication
The final step was a guided, step-by-step process to perform the first monorepo publication. This was a critical series of commands to ensure a smooth release.

1.  **Final Checks:** The `preflight` command was run one last time to verify the code was in a stable state.
2.  **Commit and Merge:** All changes were committed to a feature branch, and this branch was then merged into the `main` branch.
3.  **Tagging:** A new `v1.8.0` tag was created locally to mark the new release.
4.  **Push to GitHub:** Both the updated `main` branch and the new `v1.8.0` tag were pushed to the remote repository.

This final `git push` command triggered the **Continuous Deployment (CD) workflow**, which built and published both `shuffrand@1.8.0` and the new `datrand@0.1.0` package. The entire process was verified by the green status of the GitHub Actions and confirmed by the automated emails from the npm registry.
