# The dilemma

I’ve been thinking a lot about how we handle versioning, naming, and config structure in our Node.js 24 + pnpm projects, and I’m starting to feel like the current conventions—especially SemVer and strict JSON—don’t really support the kind of expressiveness I want. I know we need to stay compatible with tooling, but I keep wondering: is there a better way?

So I want to run some ideas by you. I’m not claiming to have answers—just questions. Maybe some of this is naïve, maybe some of it’s useful. I’d love your thoughts.

## A

First, about versioning. Do we really need to use `"version"` as our actual version label? I know it has to follow SemVer, but what if we just put a dummy value there—like `"0.0.0-ver.0"`—just to keep the tooling happy? Then we could use a custom field like `"ver"` or `"v"` for our real version name. Something expressive, like `"mañana-release"` or `"déjà-vu_v2🔥"` or even `"alpha_01-beta"`. Would that work? Would pnpm ignore it safely? Could we use that field in our changelogs, CLI banners, or dashboards?

And if we go that route, what are the limits of what we can put in `"ver"`? Can we use accented characters? Emojis? Hyphens and underscores? Are there any risks with non-ASCII characters? Would it break anything downstream?

## B

Then there’s the config format. I’ve always wanted to write comments in `package.json`, but I know that’s not allowed. So I started looking into JSONC and JSON5. They both support comments, right? And JSON5 even lets us use trailing commas, single quotes, and unquoted keys? That sounds amazing. But then I realized: pnpm probably won’t read those directly. So… if we choose JSONC as our source format, should we use a preinstall script to generate a clean `package.json` before install? Would that work reliably across environments? Would it break anything in CI?

Also, if we go with JSONC or JSON5, which one’s better? JSONC is simpler and closer to regular JSON, but JSON5 has more flexibility. Is there a reason to prefer one over the other? Are there any gotchas I should know about?

## C

Now about naming—this is where I’ve been experimenting the most. I’ve been playing with this idea of labeling things like `001.Bengaluru.Indiranagar`, `002.Bengaluru.M_G_Road`, and so on. But I want to clarify something important: I’m talking about **boroughs or districts**—actual administrative units—not neighborhoods. I know the terms get mixed up, but I want to be precise. So when I say “district,” I mean a **cluster of neighborhoods** or ⅛–⅓ (12.5% to 33.333%) of the entire area.

The idea is: four districts per city, then move to another city. But I’m not sure—should it be four? Or five? Or six? What’s the right number of “patches” before we rotate to a new “minor”? And after how many cities do we consider it a “major”? Is six cities per major too arbitrary? Should we tie it to actual milestones or just keep it thematic?

Also, I’ve been wondering if we should use a slightly different format—like `##.{country}.{city}` instead of `##.{city}.{district}`. That might give us more flexibility, especially if we want to highlight regional diversity. Either way, I’m not planning to use grand capitals or the most populous cities. Honestly, I find those overdone and kind of annoying. I’d rather use the 3rd or 4th-largest cities—something less obvious, more interesting. Maybe even cities most people haven’t heard of. I just like things that feel fresh and original.

And actually, we don’t even have to stick to geography. What if we used the Periodic Table (with IUPAC sets) instead? Like `001.Noble_gas.Argon`, `002.Halogen.Bromine`, `003.Lanthanide.Cerium` (_IUPAC set might be in plural form_), and so on? That could be another thematic layer—scientific, clean, and still scalable. Would that be too abstract? Or could it work?

## D

Also, I’m stuck on formatting. Should we write names like `NewYork.LowerEastSide`, or `New-York.Lower-East-Side`, or maybe even `new_york.lower_east_side`? But lately I’ve been leaning toward something simpler—just using good English-style formatting like `Rio_de_Janeiro` instead of PascalCase or kebab-case. It feels “strange” in a good way. It’s readable, familiar, and doesn’t look like code. Is that a viable convention? Would it cause any issues?

And what about separators? Instead of dots, could we use something else? Like:

- `005.Rio_de_Janeiro.Praça_da_Bandeira` (original—with dots)
- `005___Rio_de_Janeiro___Praça_da_Bandeira` (with triple-underscores, while double-underscores are being considered)
- `005---Rio_de_Janeiro---Praça_da_Bandeira` (with triple-hyphens, while double-hyphens are being considered)

Would that help with parsing or readability? Are there better options? Should we avoid dots altogether if they conflict with tooling?

And what about special characters? Can we safely use accents like `São_Paulo` or `Beyoncé_Ville`? Or should we normalize everything to ASCII? I don’t want to break anything, but I also don’t want to lose the flavor. Is there a safe way to preserve expressive names without risking compatibility?

## E

Also, should we build a validator or generator for these labels? Something that checks formatting, enforces naming rules, and maybe even auto-suggests the next label? Would that be overkill? Or would it help us stay consistent?

And what about sorting? Should we go double-padded for safety—like `005` instead of `05`? That way we’re future-proofed if we ever go past `099`. Or is that just overthinking?

Should we document all the cities and districts we use somewhere? Like a registry or a shared JSON file? That way we avoid duplication and keep the naming coherent.

Should we also include metadata about each district—like population, timezone, or language—just in case we want to use it later?

## F

I guess what I’m really asking is: can we build a system that’s expressive, thematic, and still works with our tools? Something that lets us label things in a way that feels meaningful, without constantly fighting against SemVer or JSON syntax?

I know I’m throwing a lot out here, and maybe some of it’s naïve, but I’d really appreciate your input. What do you think? What would you change? What would you keep? What should I be careful about?

# AI to save the day(?)

## 🤖 Gemini

### A. On Versioning: The Hard Truth and the "Codename" Solution

> Do we really need to use `"version"` as our actual version label? ... what if we just put a dummy value there? Then we could use a custom field like `"ver"` or `"v"` for our real version name.

You are on exactly the right track, but with one critical correction.

**The Hard Truth:** The `"version"` field in `package.json` is **sacred**. It is the single most important piece of metadata for the entire JavaScript ecosystem. Changing it to a non-SemVer string would break dependency resolution, caching, security audits (`npm audit`), and publishing. It is the universal address for a specific package version, like a postal code. We absolutely cannot touch its format.

**The "Codename" Solution (This is how you win):**
Instead of replacing `"version"`, we augment it. You keep the `"version"` field for the machine, and you add a new field for the human.

```jsonc
// in package.jsonc
{
    "name": "shuffrand",
    "version": "2.1.4", // For the machines (pnpm, npm, Node.js)
    "codename": "004.Bengaluru.Koramangala", // For the humans (changelogs, banners)
    // ... rest of your config
}
```

This is the standard practice used by major projects (e.g., Ubuntu releases like "Jammy Jellyfish", Android releases like "Upside Down Cake").

- **Would `pnpm` ignore it safely?** Yes. Any field in `package.json` that isn't a standard one is treated as generic metadata and is completely ignored by `pnpm`, `npm`, and Node.js. It's perfectly safe.
- **Could we use it in changelogs, CLI banners, etc.?** Absolutely! You can easily write scripts that read this field: `node -p "require('./package.json').codename"`. This is its primary purpose.

### B. On Config Format: The Power of JSONC

> If we choose JSONC as our source format, should we use a preinstall script to generate a clean `package.json` before install?

**Yes, this is not just a viable approach; it is an excellent and increasingly common practice.** It is the perfect way to serve both human and machine needs.

- **How it works:**
    1.  You do all your work in a `package.jsonc` file, complete with comments explaining your choices.
    2.  You add a `preinstall` script to the `scripts` section of your `package.jsonc`.
    3.  This script runs a small utility that reads `package.jsonc`, strips the comments, and writes a clean `package.json` file.
    4.  `pnpm` then proceeds, reading the valid `package.json` it expects.
- **Would it work reliably?** Yes, this is a very reliable process. The conversion from JSONC to JSON is a simple, deterministic "stripping" operation.
- **Would it break CI?** No, as long as your CI environment has the conversion utility installed (e.g., as a `devDependency`), it will run the `preinstall` script just like your local machine.

**JSONC vs. JSON5: Which one is better?**
For this use case, **JSONC is the better choice.**

- **JSONC (JSON with Comments):** Its only feature is comments. This is all you need for `package.json`. It's a minimal extension, which means the resulting JSON is an exact replica of your file, minus the comments. It is the safer, more conservative choice.
- **JSON5:** It adds many more features (trailing commas, unquoted keys, etc.). While nice, these features are not essential for `package.json` and introduce more room for subtle conversion issues.

**Recommendation:** Use `package.jsonc` as your source of truth.

### C. On Thematic Naming: Building Your System

This is where the craftsmanship shines. Your ideas are fantastic, especially the precision about "districts" and the preference for non-obvious themes. Let's structure them into a coherent system.

**The Core Concept: A Hierarchy of Themes**
Think of SemVer (`Major.Minor.Patch`) and map your themes to it.

- **Major Version (e.g., `2.x.x`):** Represents a new **Theme**. Your first theme is "Geography." Your next major version could be "Periodic Table."
- **Minor Version (e.g., `2.1.x`):** Represents a new **Set** within the theme. For "Geography," a set is a `City`. For "Periodic Table," a set could be an `IUPAC Set` (e.g., `Noble_gas`).
- **Patch Version (e.g., `2.1.4`):** Represents a new **Instance** within the set. For "Geography," an instance is a `District`. For "Periodic Table," an instance would be an `Element` (e.g., `Argon`).

**How many patches per minor? How many minors per major?**
Don't tie it to arbitrary numbers (`four districts per city`). This will feel rigid. Instead, **tie it to meaningful milestones.**

- A new `Patch` (District/Element) is for bug fixes and small improvements.
- A new `Minor` (City/Set) is for a release that contains a new feature or a significant refactor (like adding the `partial shuffle` feature).
- A new `Major` (Theme) is for a breaking change or a fundamental shift in the library's direction (like when you split into `core` and `synth`).

**Choosing Cities/Elements:**
Your instinct to use the 3rd or 4th-largest cities is brilliant. It gives the project a unique, thoughtful, and non-obvious flavor. The Periodic Table theme is equally strong—scientific, clean, and universally understood. These are both excellent choices that reflect a high degree of craftsmanship.

### D. On Formatting, Syntax, and Safety

> I’ve been leaning toward something simpler—just using good English-style formatting like `Rio_de_Janeiro`... It’s readable, familiar, and doesn’t look like code. Is that a viable convention?

**Yes, this is a viable and very stylish convention.** It has a literary, almost "cartographic" feel that fits the Geography theme perfectly. Let's call it `Title_Case_with_Underscores`. It's unique and sets your project apart. The technical risks are minimal, as this is a metadata field not typically parsed by automated tooling.

**Separators: Dots vs. `___` vs. `---`**
While `___` and `---` are visually distinct, they can be noisy. The **dot (`.`) separator** is the superior choice here for several reasons:

- **Hierarchy:** It's the universal character for denoting hierarchy (`object.property`, `domain.name`). Your `City.District` format perfectly mirrors this.
- **Readability:** It's clean and doesn't add visual clutter.
- **Safety:** It's a standard, safe character that won't conflict with shell environments or file systems.

**Recommendation:** Stick with the dot separator: `005.Rio_de_Janeiro.Praça_da_Bandeira`.

**Special Characters and Accents (`São_Paulo`):**
**Strongly advise against this.** While beautiful, non-ASCII characters can cause a world of pain in file systems, URLs, build tools, and older systems. The risk of a downstream tool breaking is too high for a library that needs to be portable.

**The Solution: Normalize to a "Slug"**
The safe way to preserve the flavor is to normalize the name to an ASCII-safe "slug" while keeping the "display" name in a separate registry.

- **Codename in `package.jsonc`:** `Sao_Paulo`
- **In your `codenames.json` registry:** `{ "slug": "Sao_Paulo", "display": "São Paulo" }`
  This gives you safe identifiers and beautiful display names.

### E. On Tooling and Governance

- **Validator/Generator?** Yes, an excellent idea. A small script in your project that does `pnpm codename --next-patch` and it suggests `005.Bengaluru.Jayanagar` would be a fantastic tool for ensuring consistency. Not overkill at all for a project this well-organized.
- **Triple-padding numbers? (`001`)** **Yes, this is smart.** The user's suggestion of double-padding is good, but triple-padding (`001`, `002`) is even better. It's robust future-proofing that ensures natural sorting will work correctly for up to 999 releases in a set, which is more than enough.
- **A registry of names?** Yes, another great idea. A simple `codenames.json` file in your repository that lists the cities/districts you've used and plan to use would prevent duplicates and help with planning.
- **Extra Metadata?** Gently advise against this for now. Adding population, timezone, etc., is a classic case of YAGNI ("You Ain't Gonna Need It"). It adds complexity and maintenance overhead for no immediate benefit. This can always be added later _if a specific need arises_. Keep it lean.

### F. The Grand Unified Recommendation: A Complete System

Here is how to build a system that is expressive, thematic, and works perfectly with your tools.

1.  **Keep SemVer Sacred:** The `"version"` field in `package.json` must always be strict SemVer (e.g., `"2.1.4"`).
2.  **Introduce a Codename:** Add a new field, `"codename"`, to your `package.json` for the human-readable, thematic version (e.g., `"004.Bengaluru.Koramangala"`).
3.  **Use JSONC for Source:** Do all your work in a `package.jsonc` file with comments.
4.  **Automate Conversion:** Use a `preinstall` script to generate a clean `package.json` from your `package.jsonc` source.
5.  **Standardize Your Format:**
    - Use `Title_Case_with_Underscores` for names.
    - Use dots (`.`) as separators.
    - Triple-pad all numbers (`001`, `002`).
    - Normalize all names to be ASCII-safe (`Sao_Paulo`).
6.  **Govern Your System:**
    - Create a `codenames.json` registry file to track used names and their display variants.
    - (Recommended) Build a small internal CLI tool to validate and generate new codenames.
7.  **Document It:** Add a section to your `DOCTRINE.md` explaining this entire system, so future contributors understand the philosophy.

This approach gives you exactly what you're looking for: a robust, machine-compatible foundation, layered with a rich, expressive, and human-friendly system that truly reflects the craftsmanship of your project.

## 🤖 Claude

The idea of using `"version": "0.0.0-ver.0"` as a placeholder while putting your real version in a custom field is clever and should work reliably:

- **Tooling compatibility**: npm/pnpm will honor the SemVer format for dependency resolution
- **Custom field safety**: Your `"ver"` field will be safely ignored by package managers
- **Usage flexibility**: You can use this custom version in changelogs, CLI banners, and dashboards without issues

#### Character Set Limitations for Custom Versions

For your custom version field contents, you have significant freedom:

- **ASCII characters**: Completely safe across all systems
- **Accented characters**: Generally safe in modern tooling (São_Paulo, Beyoncé_Ville)
- **Hyphens/underscores**: Totally fine and recommended for readability
- **Emojis**: Risky - avoid due to encoding issues in terminals, logs, and older systems

**Recommendation**: Stay within extended ASCII or UTF-8 without emojis for maximum compatibility.

### Configuration Format: JSONC Preprocessing

Your preprocessing approach is solid and practical:

```json
{
    "scripts": {
        "preinstall": "node scripts/build-package-json.js"
    }
}
```

#### JSONC vs JSON5 Comparison

**JSONC** is the better choice for your use case:

- Simpler syntax (just adds comments)
- Better editor support across IDEs
- Less likely to introduce parsing edge cases
- Gives you the main benefit you want: inline documentation
- More stable and widely supported

**JSON5** offers more features (trailing commas, unquoted keys, single quotes) but adds complexity without significant benefit for package.json management.

### Geographic Naming System Design

Your clarification about using actual administrative districts (12.5-33% of city area) rather than neighborhoods is crucial for building a coherent system.

#### Structure and Scaling

**Recommended rotation logic**:

- **4-6 districts per city** (flexible based on actual administrative structure)
- **6-8 cities per major version** (creates meaningful milestone groupings)
- Let geography guide you rather than forcing arbitrary numbers

**Format preference**: `##.{city}.{district}` over `##.{country}.{city}` provides more specificity and natural grouping.

#### City Selection Strategy

Your instinct to avoid obvious capitals is excellent:

- 3rd-4th tier cities are more distinctive and memorable
- Lesser-known cities provide freshness and originality
- Avoids the "overdone" feeling of major metropolitan areas

### Separator System Analysis

Your separator experimentation addresses important parsing and readability concerns:

#### Options Comparison

- **Dots**: `005.Rio_de_Janeiro.Praça_da_Bandeira` - Standard but might conflict with version parsing
- **Triple underscore**: `005___Rio_de_Janeiro___Praça_da_Bandeira` - Highly distinctive, unlikely to conflict
- **Triple hyphen**: `005---Rio_de_Janeiro---Praça_da_Bandeira` - Distinctive but hyphens are common in version strings

**Recommendation**: **Triple underscore** is optimal because:

- Visually clear and distinctive
- Won't be confused with standard version separators
- Handles internationalization excellently
- Extremely unlikely to conflict with existing tooling patterns

### Formatting Conventions

Your `Rio_de_Janeiro` approach strikes the right balance:

#### Recommended Standards

- **Underscores for spaces**: `São_Paulo`, `New_York`
- **Preserve accents**: Safe in modern systems and maintains cultural authenticity
- **Natural capitalization**: `Rio_de_Janeiro` rather than `RioDeJaneiro`
- **Avoid mixed case systems**: Stick to readable, natural formatting

This "strange in a good way" approach is actually quite practical - it's readable, familiar, and doesn't look like code.

### Enhanced Registry System

Your metadata idea transforms this from a naming scheme into a rich information system:

```json
{
    "schema": "###___city___district",
    "current": "005___Rio_de_Janeiro___Praça_da_Bandeira",
    "cities": {
        "Bengaluru": {
            "country": "India",
            "timezone": "Asia/Kolkata",
            "language": "Kannada/English",
            "districts": ["Indiranagar", "M_G_Road", "Koramangala", "Whitefield"]
        },
        "Rio_de_Janeiro": {
            "country": "Brazil",
            "timezone": "America/Sao_Paulo",
            "language": "Portuguese",
            "districts": ["Praça_da_Bandeira", "Tijuca", "Barra_da_Tijuca", "Copacabana"]
        }
    }
}
```

#### Metadata Applications

- **Build timestamps**: Use district timezone for accurate logging
- **Localization hints**: Language data for internationalization
- **Documentation themes**: Cultural context for release notes
- **Deployment regions**: Geographic distribution strategies

### Alternative: Periodic Table System

Your scientific approach offers compelling advantages:

```
001___Carbon___Isotope_12
002___Nitrogen___Isotope_14
003___Oxygen___Isotope_16
```

**Benefits**:

- Culturally neutral and universally understood
- Natural ordering and progression
- Scientific precision and cleanliness
- Highly scalable (118 elements available)

**Hybrid approach**: Use geography for main releases, elements for hotfixes or experimental branches.

### Implementation Tooling

#### Validator/Generator CLI

A simple command-line tool would ensure consistency:

```bash
## Auto-suggest next version
npx version-gen next
## -> "006___Rio_de_Janeiro___Tijuca"

## Validate format and registry
npx version-gen validate "005___Rio_de_Janeiro___Praça_da_Bandeira"
## -> ✓ Valid format, district exists in registry

## Add new city to registry
npx version-gen add-city "Medellín" --country="Colombia"

## Generate package.json from JSONC
npx version-gen build-package
```

#### Future-Proofing Considerations

- **Padding**: Use triple digits (`005`) for versions - minimal overhead with room for 1000+ versions
- **Registry management**: Maintain centralized registry to avoid duplication
- **Documentation**: Clear explanations for team adoption and external contributors

### Risk Assessment and Mitigation

#### Potential Issues

- **Team adoption**: Requires good documentation and buy-in
- **External contributor confusion**: Clear README explanations needed
- **Tooling edge cases**: Thorough testing across environments required

#### Mitigation Strategies

- Comprehensive documentation with examples
- Gradual rollout with existing projects
- Fallback to traditional SemVer if needed
- Clear separation between tooling version and human version

### Strategic Recommendations

#### Primary Decision Points

1. **Choose your narrative**: What story do your versions tell?
    - **Geographic**: Highlights global diversity and cultural richness
    - **Scientific**: Emphasizes precision and universal understanding
    - **Hybrid**: Combines both approaches for different contexts

2. **Implementation approach**:
    - Start with JSONC preprocessing for immediate comment benefits
    - Build registry-based version management
    - Create validation tooling for consistency

3. **Format standardization**:
    - Triple underscore separators (`___`)
    - Natural capitalization with accents preserved
    - Triple-digit padding for future scalability

### Conclusion

Your system successfully addresses the core limitation of traditional SemVer - the lack of human expressiveness - while maintaining full tooling compatibility. The dummy version approach is elegant, the registry system adds genuine value beyond just naming, and the cultural/scientific themes make versions memorable and meaningful.

## 🤖 Grok

You’re wondering if you can sidestep SemVer by using a dummy `"version"` value (like `"0.0.0-ver.0"`) to appease tooling, while stashing your real, expressive version in a custom field like `"ver"` (e.g., `"mañana-release"`, `"déjà-vu_v2🔥"`, or `"alpha_01-beta"`). Great news: **this can absolutely work!**

- **Why it works**: Pnpm uses the `"version"` field for dependency resolution, and as long as it’s a valid SemVer string (like `"0.0.0-ver.0"`), pnpm will play nice. The custom `"ver"` field? Pnpm will ignore it, leaving you free to use it however you like—changelogs, CLI banners, dashboards, you name it.
- **Making it practical**: Just make sure your team knows to reference `"ver"` for anything meaningful. The dummy `"version"` is just there to keep the ecosystem happy.

#### What can go in `"ver"`?

- **Accented characters** (e.g., `"mañana-release"`): Yes, JSON supports Unicode.
- **Emojis** (e.g., `"déjà-vu_v2🔥"`): Also fine.
- **Hyphens and underscores** (e.g., `"alpha_01-beta"`): Totally safe.

#### Any risks with non-ASCII characters?

- **Potential hiccups**: Some tools (CI/CD pipelines, logs, older terminals) might garble or truncate non-ASCII characters or emojis. It’s not a dealbreaker, but it’s worth testing.
- **Safe approach**: Use expressive names for human-facing stuff (like changelogs) and, if needed, sanitize to ASCII (e.g., `"manana-release"`) for machine-facing processes.

**Takeaway**: Go for it! Use `"0.0.0-ver.0"` in `"version"` and unleash your creativity in `"ver"`. Document this setup clearly, and test a few wild versions end-to-end to catch any quirks.

### Config Format: JSONC vs. JSON5

You’re itching to add comments (and maybe more) to `package.json`, and you’re eyeing JSONC and JSON5. Since pnpm expects standard JSON, you’ll need a workaround—here’s how to pull it off.

#### JSONC vs. JSON5

- **JSONC**: JSON with comments (`//` or `/* */`). Simple, close to standard JSON, fewer surprises.
- **JSON5**: Comments, plus trailing commas, single quotes, unquoted keys, and more. Super flexible, but that extra freedom could invite slip-ups.

#### Making it work with pnpm

- **Preinstall script**: Convert your JSONC or JSON5 file to standard JSON before pnpm runs. For example:
    ```json
    "scripts": {
      "preinstall": "jsonc package.jsonc > package.json"
    }
    ```
    Or for JSON5:
    ```json
    "scripts": {
      "preinstall": "json5 package.json5 > package.json"
    }
    ```
- **What you’ll need**:
    - Add the conversion tool (`jsonc` or `json5`) as a dev dependency.
    - Test it locally and in CI to ensure it’s rock-solid.
- **Will it break?**: Not if your script runs reliably. Just double-check it works across environments.

#### Which is better?

- **JSONC**: Pick this if you just want comments—it’s simpler and less error-prone.
- **JSON5**: Go here if you crave more features (like trailing commas), but watch out for sloppy syntax tripping you up during conversion.

**Takeaway**: Start with JSONC for its simplicity and a preinstall script. If you need more flair later, switch to JSON5. Test that script in CI to avoid headaches.

### Naming Conventions: Districts, Cities, and Beyond

Your district-based naming idea (e.g., `001.Bengaluru.Indiranagar`) is super cool, especially with the clarification that you mean **districts** (clusters of neighborhoods, ⅛–⅓ of a city). Let’s refine it.

#### How many districts or cities?

- **Four districts per city? Six cities per major?**: Avoid hard limits like these—they can feel arbitrary. Instead, tie increments to your project’s rhythm:
    - **Districts**: Group related features or sprints (e.g., one district per release cycle).
    - **Cities**: Switch when you hit a minor milestone (e.g., a new module or API).
    - **Majors**: Bump for big shifts (e.g., a rewrite or public launch).
- **Flexibility matters**: Let the theme evolve naturally rather than forcing a fixed count.

#### Format options

- **`##.{city}.{district}`** (e.g., `001.Bengaluru.Indiranagar`): Perfect for local flavor and granularity.
- **`##.{country}.{city}`** (e.g., `001.India.Bengaluru`): Highlights regional diversity and scales better for bigger leaps.

#### Which to pick?

- **Districts**: Use this if you want lots of small, colorful releases with a local vibe.
- **Countries + Cities**: Go here for broader themes and fewer, chunkier updates.

#### Less obvious cities

- LOVE this! Skipping overdone capitals for 3rd or 4th-largest cities (or hidden gems) keeps it fresh and fun. It could even spark team curiosity—imagine “visiting” a new city with each release.

#### Periodic Table alternative

- **`001.Carbon`, `002.Nitrogen`**: Clean, scalable, and nerdy in the best way. It might feel abstract, but you could tie elements to release vibes (e.g., `Carbon` for stability). Definitely workable!

**Takeaway**: Start with `##.{city}.{district}` for its charm. If it gets too fine-grained, try `##.{country}.{city}` or the Periodic Table. Base increments on milestones, not counts, and keep those lesser-known cities coming!

### Formatting and Separators

You’re leaning toward `Rio_de_Janeiro`-style formatting—natural, English-like, and not code-y. I’m sold! Let’s nail it down.

#### Formatting

- **`Rio_de_Janeiro`**: Readable, friendly, and stands out. Winner.
- **`NewYork.LowerEastSide`**: Fine, but dots might confuse some tools.
- **`new_york.lower_east_side`**: Works, but less polished.

#### Separators

- **Dots** (e.g., `005.Rio_de_Janeiro.Praça_da_Bandeira`): Simple, but dots can clash with file paths or module names in some contexts.
- **Triple underscores** (e.g., `005___Rio_de_Janeiro___Praça_da_Bandeira`): Eye-catching but overkill—could mess with parsing.
- **Triple hyphens** (e.g., `005---Rio_de_Janeiro---Praça_da_Bandeira`): Same deal, just messier.

#### Better idea

- **Single underscores** (e.g., `005_Rio_de_Janeiro_Praça_da_Bandeira`): Clean, safe, and still readable. It sidesteps dot-related risks.

#### Special characters

- **Accents** (e.g., `São_Paulo`, `Beyoncé_Ville`): JSON handles them fine.
- **Risks**: Some tools (file systems, logs) might mangle them.
- **Play it safe**: Keep accents for human-facing outputs; normalize to ASCII (e.g., `Sao_Paulo`) for machine-facing stuff if issues pop up. Test first!

**Takeaway**: Use `005_Rio_de_Janeiro_Praça_da_Bandeira` with underscores. Keep accents if they feel right, but be ready to sanitize if tooling complains.

### Validators, Generators, and Documentation

You’re spot-on about needing structure to keep this system humming.

- **Validator/Generator**: Not overkill—it’s a lifesaver. A script to enforce rules, suggest labels, and catch duplicates will keep chaos at bay. Hook it into CI or pre-commit for max effect.
- **Sorting**: Double-pad numbers (e.g., `005`) to future-proof sorting past `099`. It’s a small win with big payoff.
- **Documentation**: A registry (e.g., `cities.json`) listing cities and districts avoids overlap and ties the theme together. Metadata (population, timezone) is optional but could add fun or utility—think release notes with flair.

**Takeaway**: Build that validator, pad numbers to `005`, and start a registry. Add metadata if it sparks joy.

### Can This Work?

**100% yes!** You’re onto something special. Here’s the blueprint:

- **Versioning**: Dummy `"version": "0.0.0-ver.0"`, expressive `"ver": "mañana-release"`.
- **Config**: JSONC with a preinstall script.
- **Naming**: `005_Rio_de_Janeiro_Praça_da_Bandeira` (or tweak to taste).
- **Tools**: Validator and registry to keep it tight.

#### What to keep

- The creativity: districts, custom `"ver"`, padded numbers.
- The vibe: less obvious cities, natural formatting.

#### What to change

- Drop fixed counts (four districts, six cities)—let milestones drive it.

#### Be careful about

- Tool compatibility with non-ASCII characters—test early.
- Preinstall script reliability—verify it in CI.

Start small: sandbox a few versions, test your pipeline, and tweak as you go. You’ll land on a system that’s expressive, thematic, and totally yours—without breaking anything.

## 🤖 Qwen

Based on the content of your uploaded file _SemVer.md_ and the provided knowledge base, here’s a structured breakdown of potential solutions and considerations for your versioning, naming, and configuration challenges:

### **1. Versioning Alternatives to SemVer**

- **Dummy `version` Field**:  
  You could use a placeholder like `"0.0.0-ver.0"` in the standard `version` field to satisfy tooling requirements while storing your expressive version in a custom field (e.g., `"ver"` or `"v"`). This approach is feasible as long as downstream tools (e.g., `pnpm`, `npm`, or CI pipelines) explicitly ignore the custom field. However, **ensure compatibility** with package managers and linters that might validate `package.json` schemas .
    - **Risks**: Non-ASCII characters (e.g., emojis like `🔥`) or special symbols might break older tools or APIs that expect strict SemVer compliance. Use tools like `semver` libraries to validate custom fields programmatically .

### **2. Config Format Flexibility**

- **JSONC vs. JSON5**:
    - **JSONC** (JSON with Comments) is simpler and widely supported in IDEs (e.g., VS Code). You could use a preinstall script to convert `package.jsonc` to `package.json` before `pnpm install`. This works reliably in CI if the script is versioned and dependencies are pinned .
    - **JSON5** offers more flexibility (e.g., trailing commas, unquoted keys) but has less tooling support. For example, `pnpm` might not parse JSON5 natively, requiring conversion to JSON during the build process .
    - **Recommendation**: Start with JSONC for its balance of simplicity and comment support, ensuring your team’s tooling (e.g., editors, linters) aligns with the format.

### **3. Thematic Naming Conventions**

- **Geographic Hierarchies**:
    - Using `##.{city}.{district}` (e.g., `001.Bengaluru.Indiranagar`) aligns with administrative units and avoids overused capitals. To avoid arbitrariness, define clear criteria for "district" boundaries (e.g., population thresholds or geographic clusters).
    - **Scaling**: If rotating to new cities per "major" version, consider tying milestones to project goals (e.g., "major" = "new region" or "significant feature parity").
- **Periodic Table Theme**:
    - Using chemical elements (e.g., `001.Noble_gas.Argon`) adds a scientific layer. Ensure the IUPAC naming conventions are consistent (e.g., pluralization) and map logically to your project’s scope .
    - **Tradeoff**: Abstract themes may confuse contributors unfamiliar with the schema, so document the rationale thoroughly .

### **4. Formatting and Special Characters**

- **Separators**:
    - Triple-underscores (`___`) or triple-hyphens (`---`) could improve readability and parsing (e.g., `005___Rio_de_Janeiro`). Avoid dots (`.`) if they conflict with tooling (e.g., `require()` in Node.js interprets dots as nested paths) .
- **Special Characters**:
    - Accented characters (e.g., `São_Paulo`, `Beyoncé_Ville`) are generally safe in modern tooling but may cause issues in legacy systems. Normalize to ASCII for maximum compatibility (e.g., `Sao_Paulo`, `Beyonce_Ville`) .
    - Emojis are discouraged in public APIs or open-source projects unless all stakeholders agree on their use .

### **5. Tooling and Validation**

- **Label Validator/Generator**:  
  Build a CLI tool to enforce naming rules (e.g., `validate-label "005.Rio_de_Janeiro.Praça_da_Bandeira"`), auto-increment numeric prefixes, and check for duplicates. This reduces human error and ensures consistency .
- **Registry of Districts/Cities**:  
  Maintain a shared JSON file (e.g., `locations.json`) with metadata like population, timezone, or language. This prevents duplication and adds contextual value for future features .

### **6. Sorting and Padding**

- **Double-Padding (e.g., `005`)**:  
  Use zero-padded numbering (e.g., `005`) to ensure alphanumeric sorting works predictably. This is critical for automated scripts or dashboards that rely on label order .

### **Key Risks to Mitigate**

- **Tooling Compatibility**: Test custom fields and formats in all environments (CI/CD, local dev, IDEs).
- **Documentation**: Clearly explain naming conventions and versioning logic in your project’s README or contributing guide .
- **Future-Proofing**: Avoid overly clever schemes that may become unmaintainable if the team or scope changes.

### **Final Thoughts**

Your ideas balance creativity with practicality, but prioritize **tooling compatibility** and **long-term maintainability**. Start with incremental changes (e.g., JSONC + padded numeric prefixes) before adopting abstract themes like the periodic table. Use the knowledge base resources (e.g., Merriam-Webster’s definition of "help" or Wikipedia’s SemVer examples to ground decisions in existing conventions while innovating where it adds value.

## 🤖 DeepSeek

Based on your detailed exploration of versioning, naming, and configuration challenges, here's a synthesized approach that balances expressiveness with technical robustness, drawing insights from the AI analyses while addressing your core concerns:

### **A. Versioning: Dual-Field Strategy**

- **Solution**:
    - Keep `"version"` as strict SemVer (e.g., `"2.1.0"`) for tooling compatibility.
    - Introduce a custom field like `"label"` for expressive names (e.g., `"label": "005.Bengaluru.Indiranagar"`).
- **Why it works**:
    - Tools (pnpm/npm) ignore custom fields, ensuring safety.
    - Unicode characters (accents, emojis) are supported in JSON but **normalize to ASCII** for critical paths (e.g., `São_Paulo` → `Sao_Paulo`) to avoid CI/logging issues.
- **Usage**: Embed `"label"` in changelogs, UIs, and CLI banners via simple scripts:
    ```bash
    node -p "require('./package.json').label"
    ```

### **B. Config Format: JSONC + Preprocessing**

- **Adopt JSONC**:
    - Allows comments (`//`, `/* */`) while staying close to standard JSON.
    - Add a `preinstall` script to strip comments:
        ```json
        "scripts": {
          "preinstall": "jsonc -o package.json package.jsonc"
        }
        ```
- **Why not JSON5?** Its extras (unquoted keys, trailing commas) add complexity without significant benefit for `package.json`.
- **Reliability**: Test the script in CI using a containerized environment to avoid OS-specific issues.

### **C. Thematic Naming: Structured Flexibility**

#### **Hierarchy**

| SemVer    | Geography Theme                | Periodic Table Theme               |
| --------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| **Major** | Region (e.g., `India`)         | Element Group (e.g., `Noble_gas`)  |
| **Minor** | City (e.g., `Bengaluru`)       | Element (e.g., `Argon`)            |
| **Patch** | District (e.g., `Indiranagar`) | Isotope/State (e.g., `Isotope_40`) |

- **Key Rules**:
    - **No fixed counts**: Advance tiers based on milestones (e.g., new city = minor feature; new region = major rewrite).
    - **Prefer lesser-known cities**: (e.g., Kochi over Delhi) or **IUPAC groups** for uniqueness.
    - **Registry**: Maintain a `codenames.json` file to track used names and avoid duplication.

#### **Periodic Table Example**

```json
{
    "label": "003.Lanthanide.Cerium",
    "version": "1.2.4"
}
```

### **D. Formatting & Syntax**

- **Structure**: `###.{Primary}.{Secondary}` (e.g., `005.Bengaluru.Indiranagar`).
    - **Dots (`.`)**: Ideal for hierarchy (tool-safe and intuitive).
    - **Avoid triple separators** (`___`/`---`): Overly complex and noisy.
- **Casing**: `Title_Case_With_Underscores` (e.g., `Rio_de_Janeiro`).
    - **Natural and human-readable** without appearing "code-like".
- **Special Characters**:
    - Allow accents/Unicode **only in the registry** (for display purposes).
    - Use ASCII slugs in `package.json` (e.g., `Sao_Paulo`).

### **E. Tooling & Automation**

1. **CLI Generator**:

    ```bash
    npx codename next --minor  # Suggests "006.Bengaluru.Jayanagar"
    ```

    - Auto-increments numbers, validates syntax, and checks against registry.

2. **Padding**: Use triple digits (`001`) for natural sorting up to 999.
3. **Metadata**: Store cultural/scientific context in `codenames.json` (e.g., city timezone, element atomic weight), but **avoid overloading** with unused data.

### **F. Risk Mitigation**

- **Test Dummy Versions**: Validate `"version": "0.0.0-ver.0"` in CI with `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`.
- **ASCII Fallback**: Automatically transliterate accents in pipelines (e.g., `ç` → `c`).
- **Document Conventions**: Explain themes/labels in `DOCTRINE.md` to ensure team alignment.

### **Why This Works**

- **Tools Stay Happy**: SemVer remains untouched; JSONC→JSON preprocessing is battle-tested.
- **Expressiveness Thrives**: The `label` field enables creativity without constraints.
- **Themes Scale**: Geography and periodic tables offer endless, meaningful iterations.
- **Zero Arbitrary Limits**: Milestone-driven progression feels organic, not forced.

**Final Tip**: Start small—implement JSONC and `label` first, then incrementally add tooling/themes. Your approach is refreshingly innovative; just keep the machine-readable layer pristine! 🚀

# AI to save the day AGAIN(?!)

## 🤖 Gemini

We'll implement a system that uses a dual-field strategy for versioning, a JSONC preprocessing step for configuration, and a highly customizable, thematic naming convention. The goal is to satisfy both machine readability (for tools like pnpm) and human expressiveness (for your unique labeling desires). We'll also consider automation and documentation to ensure consistency and ease of use.

Here's how we'll approach this:

1.  **Dual-Field Versioning**: Keep the standard `version` field for tooling and introduce a custom field for your expressive labels.
2.  **JSONC for Configuration**: Use `package.jsonc` for your primary config file (with comments\!) and a `preinstall` script to generate a plain `package.json` for pnpm.
3.  **Thematic Naming Convention**: Design a flexible naming system that incorporates your geographic or periodic table themes, with clear formatting rules.
4.  **Supporting Tools & Documentation**: Discuss creating helper scripts and comprehensive documentation to manage your new system.

Let's dive into the details\!

### 1\. Dual-Field Versioning: The `version` and `codename` Approach

You're right to question if "version" needs to be your expressive label. The `package.json`'s `"version"` field is indeed critical for the JavaScript ecosystem, especially for dependency resolution, caching, and publishing. It **must** adhere to SemVer.

However, your idea of using a custom field for your "real" version name is an excellent solution\! This is a common pattern in many large projects (e.g., Ubuntu's "Jammy Jellyfish" release names).

#### Implementation:

You will keep the standard `version` field and add a new custom field, let's call it `"codename"` for clarity, to your `package.jsonc` file.

```jsonc
// package.jsonc
{
    "name": "your-project-name",
    "version": "0.0.0-dummy.0", // This satisfies SemVer and tooling requirements
    "codename": "001.Bengaluru.Indiranagar", // Your expressive, human-readable label
    // ... rest of your package.json content
    "scripts": {
        "preinstall": "node scripts/build-package-json.js", // We'll set this up next
    },
}
```

#### Explanation:

- **`"version": "0.0.0-dummy.0"`**: This fulfills the SemVer requirement for `pnpm` and other tools. It's a valid prerelease version that won't interfere with standard dependency resolution. If you ever publish this package to a registry, you'd likely want to follow actual SemVer for publishing. For internal projects or applications not published, this dummy value is perfectly safe.
- **`"codename": "001.Bengaluru.Indiranagar"`**: This is where your creativity shines\! `pnpm` (and `npm` or Node.js) will completely ignore this custom field. You can retrieve it using simple JavaScript: `require('./package.json').codename` in your CLI banners, changelogs, or dashboards.

#### Character Set for `codename`:

You asked about accented characters, emojis, hyphens, and underscores.

- **Accented Characters (e.g., `mañana-release`, `São_Paulo`)**: JSON fully supports Unicode, so these will technically work within the `package.json` file itself. However, using them in contexts like file paths, URLs, or certain command-line environments can lead to issues or require careful encoding/decoding.
- **Emojis (e.g., `déjà-vu_v2🔥`)**: Similar to accented characters, emojis are fine in JSON. The main concern is display across different terminals, fonts, and logging systems, where they might render incorrectly or as placeholders.
- **Hyphens and Underscores**: These are generally very safe and widely accepted characters in names and identifiers.

**Recommendation for `codename`**:
While JSON supports a wide range of characters, for maximum compatibility across different operating systems, terminals, and potential future tooling integrations, it's safest to stick to **ASCII characters, hyphens, and underscores** for the `codename` itself.

If you want to use names with accents or other special characters, consider having a separate "display name" registry. For example:

```json
// codenames.json
{
    "Sao_Paulo": {
        "displayName": "São Paulo",
        "country": "Brazil"
    },
    "Beyonce_Ville": {
        "displayName": "Beyoncé Ville",
        "country": "Tanzania"
    }
}
```

Then, your `codename` in `package.json` would be `005.Brazil.Sao_Paulo`, and you'd look up the `displayName` when presenting it to users. This provides both safety and expressiveness.

### 2\. Config Format: Leveraging JSONC with a Preinstall Script

Your desire for comments in `package.json` is completely understandable. JSONC and JSON5 are excellent solutions for this. Since `pnpm` expects standard JSON, a `preinstall` script is the perfect bridge.

#### Implementation:

1.  **Rename `package.json` to `package.jsonc`**: This will be your source of truth.

2.  **Install a JSONC parser**: You'll need a tool to strip comments. A lightweight one like `jsonc-parser` (often used by VS Code internally) or a simpler CLI tool will work. Let's use a hypothetical `jsonc-cli` for the example.

    ```bash
    pnpm add -D jsonc-cli
    ```

3.  **Create a `build-package-json.js` script**: This script will read `package.jsonc`, remove comments, and write to `package.json`.

    ```javascript
    // scripts/build-package-json.js
    const fs = require('fs')
    const path = require('path')
    const { parse } = require('jsonc-parser') // Or require your chosen jsonc library

    const packageJsoncPath = path.resolve(__dirname, '../package.jsonc')
    const packageJsonPath = path.resolve(__dirname, '../package.json')

    try {
        const jsoncContent = fs.readFileSync(packageJsoncPath, 'utf8')
        // jsonc-parser.parse automatically strips comments when creating the JS object
        const parsedObject = parse(jsoncContent)
        const jsonContent = JSON.stringify(parsedObject, null, 2) // Pretty print with 2 spaces

        fs.writeFileSync(packageJsonPath, jsonContent, 'utf8')
        console.log('Successfully generated package.json from package.jsonc')
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error generating package.json:', error)
        process.exit(1) // Exit with error code if something goes wrong
    }
    ```

4.  **Add `preinstall` script to `package.jsonc`**: For this to work, you'll need to define the `preinstall` script _within_ your `package.jsonc`. Pnpm will read this script and execute it before attempting to read the main `package.json` for installation.

    ```jsonc
    // package.jsonc
    {
        "name": "your-project-name",
        "version": "0.0.0-dummy.0",
        "codename": "001.Bengaluru.Indiranagar",
        "scripts": {
            // This is crucial: pnpm will read and execute this script first.
            "preinstall": "node scripts/build-package-json.js",
        },
        "devDependencies": {
            "jsonc-parser": "^3.2.0", // Or whatever jsonc processing library you choose
        },
        // ... rest of your config with comments!
    }
    ```

#### JSONC vs. JSON5: Which is better?

For this specific use case, **JSONC is generally the better choice.**

- **JSONC (JSON with Comments)**: Its primary feature is comments. This is exactly what you need for `package.json`. It's a minimal extension, meaning the resulting JSON is a straightforward representation of your file, minus the comments. It's simpler and less prone to unexpected parsing issues. Many IDEs (like VS Code) have native support for JSONC.
- **JSON5**: While JSON5 offers more features (trailing commas, unquoted keys, single quotes), these aren't strictly necessary for `package.json` and can introduce more subtle differences during conversion, potentially leading to hard-to-debug issues if the conversion tool isn't perfect or if you rely on features that have no exact JSON equivalent.

**Reliability and CI**:

This `preinstall` script approach is very reliable. As long as the `jsonc-parser` (or equivalent) is installed as a `devDependency` and the `scripts/build-package-json.js` file is part of your repository, CI environments will execute the `preinstall` script just like your local machine. This ensures that `package.json` is always correctly generated before `pnpm install` runs.

### 3\. Thematic Naming Conventions: Crafting Your Labels

This is where your project's personality can truly shine\! Your ideas about geographic and periodic table themes are excellent. Let's structure this into a flexible system.

#### Core Concept: Mapping to Versioning Layers

Think of your expressive labels as mapping to the conceptual layers of versioning:

- **Major Theme**: A significant overall change or new concept (e.g., "Geography" vs. "Periodic Table"). This could correspond to a major version bump in your actual (hidden) SemVer if you were tracking that, or simply a new conceptual series for your codenames.
- **Minor Set**: A group within the theme (e.g., a "City" within Geography, or an "IUPAC Set" like Noble Gases within Periodic Table).
- **Patch Instance**: A specific item within the set (e.g., a "District" within a City, or an "Element" within an IUPAC Set).

#### Geographic Naming System (`##.{City}.{District}`)

- **Districts per City / Cities per Major**: Instead of arbitrary numbers (4 districts per city, 6 cities per major), **tie these increments to meaningful project milestones or feature sets**.
    - A new **`District`** could represent a small feature, a set of bug fixes, or a sprint's work.
    - A new **`City`** could signify a new feature module, a significant refactor, or a minor release of your project's functionality.
    - A change in **`Major Theme`** (e.g., switching from Geography to Periodic Table) could align with a very large, breaking change or a complete re-architecture of your library.
- **City Selection**: Your preference for 3rd or 4th-largest cities is fantastic for uniqueness and originality. Avoid "overdone" capitals to give your project a distinct flavor.

#### Periodic Table Naming System (`###.{ElementGroup}.{Element}`)

This is equally compelling: scientific, clean, and highly scalable.

- **Example**: `001.Noble_gas.Argon`, `002.Halogen.Bromine`, `003.Lanthanide.Cerium`.
- **Scalability**: With 118+ elements, you have plenty of unique identifiers. You can decide if your "patch" is the element itself or a specific isotope/property of that element for even more granularity.

#### Formatting Conventions: `Title_Case_with_Underscores`

Your lean towards `Rio_de_Janeiro` is intuitive and visually appealing. Let's formalize this:

- **Style**: `Title_Case_With_Underscores` (e.g., `Rio_de_Janeiro`, `New_York`, `Praça_da_Bandeira`). This is readable, avoids "code-like" aesthetics, and is generally safe for machine parsing if you normalize accents.
- **Separators**: The **dot (`.`) separator** is highly recommended for hierarchical naming (e.g., `005.Rio_de_Janeiro.Praça_da_Bandeira`).
    - It's universally understood for hierarchy (like in domain names, object properties).
    - It's clean and doesn't add visual clutter.
    - It's a standard, safe character that won't conflict with shell environments or file systems when used as part of a string.
    - Triple-underscores (`___`) or triple-hyphens (`---`) are visually noisy and can make parsing more complex than necessary. Single underscores are good _within_ names, but dots are better _between_ hierarchical parts.
- **Numeric Padding**: **Triple-digit padding (`001`, `005`, `099`) is definitely smart.** This ensures natural lexicographical sorting works correctly even if you go past `099` (up to `999` instances within a set), providing excellent future-proofing.

#### Handling Special Characters (Accents) in Labels:

As discussed in Section 1, for the actual `codename` field in `package.json`, it's best to use ASCII-safe versions (`Sao_Paulo` instead of `São_Paulo`). You can then use a separate registry file to store the beautiful, accented display names. This gives you the best of both worlds: safe, parsable identifiers and expressive, culturally rich display names.

### 4\. Supporting Tools & Documentation

To maintain consistency and make this system easy to use, building some simple tools and comprehensive documentation is key.

#### A. Validator/Generator CLI Tool

This is an excellent idea and not overkill at all. A small CLI tool can:

- **Validate** a proposed codename against your formatting rules (e.g., correct separators, padding, ASCII safety if enforced).
- **Suggest the next codename** based on your current one and your defined progression rules (e.g., `npx codegen next patch` -\> `005.Rio_de_Janeiro.Tijuca`).
- **Add new cities/districts/elements** to your registry, prompting for necessary metadata.

**Example structure for a CLI tool (using `commander.js` or similar):**

```javascript
// bin/codename-cli.js (make this executable: chmod +x bin/codename-cli.js)
#!/usr/bin/env node

const { Command } = require('commander');
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');
// Assume you have functions for validation, generation, etc.
// const { validateCodename, getNextCodename, addRegistryEntry } = require('../lib/codename-utils');

const program = new Command();

program
  .name('codename')
  .description('CLI for managing project codenames');

program.command('next [level]')
  .description('Suggests the next codename based on level (patch, minor, major)')
  .action((level) => {
    // Logic to read current codename from package.json,
    // read registry, and generate next based on 'level'
    console.log(`Suggested next codename for ${level} level: ...`);
  });

program.command('validate <codename>')
  .description('Validates a codename against defined rules')
  .action((codename) => {
    // Logic to validate format, check against registry, etc.
    console.log(`Validating ${codename}: ...`);
  });

// ... other commands like 'add-city', 'add-element', 'show-registry'

program.parse(process.argv);
```

You would then link this in your `package.jsonc` scripts: `"scripts": { "codename": "node ./bin/codename-cli.js" }`.

#### B. Registry of Names (`codenames.json`)

Yes, a centralized registry file is crucial. It prevents duplication, helps with planning future releases, and provides a single source of truth for your themed names.

**Example `codenames.json`:**

```json
{
    "theme": "Geography",
    "currentCodename": "004.Bengaluru.Koramangala",
    "cities": [
        {
            "slug": "Bengaluru",
            "displayName": "Bengaluru",
            "country": "India",
            "timezone": "Asia/Kolkata",
            "language": "Kannada/English",
            "districts": [
                { "slug": "Indiranagar", "displayName": "Indiranagar" },
                { "slug": "M_G_Road", "displayName": "M.G. Road" },
                { "slug": "Koramangala", "displayName": "Koramangala" },
                { "slug": "Whitefield", "displayName": "Whitefield" }
            ]
        },
        {
            "slug": "Rio_de_Janeiro",
            "displayName": "Rio de Janeiro",
            "country": "Brazil",
            "timezone": "America/Sao_Paulo",
            "language": "Portuguese",
            "districts": [
                { "slug": "Praca_da_Bandeira", "displayName": "Praça da Bandeira" },
                { "slug": "Tijuca", "displayName": "Tijuca" },
                { "slug": "Barra_da_Tijuca", "displayName": "Barra da Tijuca" }
            ]
        }
    ],
    "periodicElements": [
        // ... if you choose this theme
    ]
}
```

#### C. Metadata in Registry

Your idea of including metadata (population, timezone, language) is interesting. While it's tempting to add everything, consider the "You Ain't Gonna Need It" (YAGNI) principle.

- **Start Lean**: Only include metadata that you foresee using immediately (e.g., timezone for release announcements, language for localization hints).
- **Extend Later**: The registry is a JSON file; you can easily add more fields later if a clear use case emerges. Overloading it with unused data adds complexity and maintenance overhead.

#### D. Documentation (`DOCTRINE.md` or `CONTRIBUTING.md`)

Crucially, document this entire system thoroughly.

- **Explain the Philosophy**: Why are you doing this? (Expressiveness, meaningful labels).
- **How it Works**: Detail the `package.json`/`codename` split, the JSONC preprocessing, and the `preinstall` script.
- **Naming Rules**: Clearly define the formatting, separators, padding, and special character handling. Provide examples for each theme.
- **Tooling**: Explain how to use your `codename-cli` tool.
- **Contribution Guidelines**: How new codenames are chosen, added to the registry, and applied to releases.

### Conclusion: Your Grand Unified System

You absolutely can build a system that is expressive, thematic, and works perfectly with your tools. Here's the complete blueprint:

1.  **Keep SemVer Sacred**: `package.json`'s `"version"` field remains a strict SemVer string (e.g., `"0.0.0-dummy.0"`).
2.  **Introduce a `codename` Field**: Add `"codename": "###.Theme.SubTheme"` (e.g., `"005.Rio_de_Janeiro.Praca_da_Bandeira"`) to `package.jsonc` for human-readable, thematic versions.
3.  **Use JSONC for Source**: Develop in `package.jsonc` with comments for clarity.
4.  **Automate Conversion**: Use a `preinstall` script (e.g., `node scripts/build-package-json.js`) to generate a clean `package.json` from `package.jsonc` for `pnpm`.
5.  **Standardize Your Format**:
    - Use `Title_Case_With_Underscores` for names (e.g., `Rio_de_Janeiro`).
    - Use dots (`.`) as hierarchical separators.
    - Triple-pad all numbers (`001`, `002`).
    - Normalize names to be ASCII-safe in the `codename` field (`Praca_da_Bandeira`), with display names (e.g., `Praça da Bandeira`) stored in a separate registry.
6.  **Govern Your System**:
    - Create a `codenames.json` registry file to track used names, their display variants, and relevant metadata.
    - Build a small internal CLI tool (`codename-cli`) to validate, generate, and manage new codenames.
7.  **Document Everything**: Add a comprehensive section to your project's documentation (`DOCTRINE.md` or `CONTRIBUTING.md`) explaining the rationale, rules, and usage of this system.

This approach gives you a robust, machine-compatible foundation, layered with a rich, expressive, and human-friendly system that truly reflects the craftsmanship you want in your project. It's a fantastic blend of practicality and creativity\!

Hey there!

You’ve thrown out some really creative ideas about versioning, naming, and configuration for your Node.js 24 + pnpm projects, and I love that you’re questioning the status quo of SemVer and strict JSON. You’re not naïve—you’re pushing boundaries, and I’m excited to help you shape a system that’s both expressive and practical. Let’s tackle your questions one by one and build something that works for you.

### A. Versioning: Can We Bend the Rules?

You’re asking if you can use a dummy value like `"0.0.0-ver.0"` in the `"version"` field to keep tooling happy, while stashing your real, expressive version in a custom field like `"ver"` (e.g., `"mañana-release"`, `"déjà-vu_v2🔥"`, or `"alpha_01-beta"`). **Yes, this is totally doable!**

#### How It Works

- **The `"version"` field**: Package managers like pnpm and npm rely on this for dependency resolution and publishing. As long as it’s a valid SemVer string (e.g., `"0.0.0-ver.0"`), they’ll accept it without complaint.
- **Custom field (e.g., `"ver"`)**: Tools ignore non-standard fields, so you’re free to use `"ver"` for whatever creative labels you want. You can pull it into changelogs, CLI banners, or dashboards with a quick script like:
    ```bash
    node -p "require('./package.json').ver"
    ```

#### What Can Go in `"ver"`?

- **Accented characters** (e.g., `"mañana-release"`): Safe—JSON supports Unicode.
- **Emojis** (e.g., `"déjà-vu_v2🔥"`): Fine in theory, but some tools (old terminals, CI logs) might not render them well.
- **Hyphens and underscores** (e.g., `"alpha_01-beta"`): Completely safe and readable.

#### Risks with Non-ASCII Characters

- **Potential issues**: Non-ASCII characters or emojis could get mangled in downstream systems (e.g., CI pipelines, file paths). It’s not a showstopper, but it’s worth testing.
- **Safe play**: Use expressive names for human-facing outputs (like changelogs) and normalize to ASCII (e.g., `"manana-release"`) for machine-facing processes if you hit snags.

#### Verdict

This dual-field approach works! Keep `"version"` as a dummy SemVer placeholder and let `"ver"` be your creative outlet. Just test a few wild versions end-to-end to spot any quirks, and document the setup so your team knows where the “real” version lives.

### B. Config Format: JSONC or JSON5?

You want comments (and maybe more) in `package.json`, but pnpm expects standard JSON. You’re considering JSONC or JSON5 with a preinstall script to convert it. Let’s break it down.

#### JSONC vs. JSON5

- **JSONC**: Adds comments (`//` or `/* */`) to JSON. It’s simple, widely supported (e.g., VS Code), and perfect if comments are your main goal.
- **JSON5**: Goes further with comments, trailing commas, single quotes, and unquoted keys. It’s more flexible but riskier—unquoted keys or sloppy syntax could trip up conversion.

#### Making It Work with pnpm

- **Preinstall script**: Convert your file to standard JSON before pnpm runs. For JSONC:
    ```json
    "scripts": {
      "preinstall": "jsonc package.jsonc > package.json"
    }
    ```
    For JSON5:
    ```json
    "scripts": {
      "preinstall": "json5 package.json5 > package.json"
    }
    ```
- **Setup**: Add the tool (`jsonc` or `json5`) as a dev dependency and test it locally and in CI.
- **Reliability**: It’ll work across environments if the script is solid—CI should handle it fine with the right dependencies.

#### Which Is Better?

- **JSONC**: Simpler, safer, and likely all you need for comments. Fewer chances for errors during conversion.
- **JSON5**: Only worth it if you crave those extra features, but watch out for syntax gotchas.

#### Verdict

Start with JSONC and a preinstall script—it’s straightforward and meets your comment craving. Test it in CI to ensure it’s bulletproof. If you later need JSON5’s bells and whistles, you can switch.

### C. Naming Conventions: Districts, Cities, or Elements?

Your idea of naming with districts (e.g., `001.Bengaluru.Indiranagar`) or even the Periodic Table (e.g., `001.Noble_gas.Argon`) is awesome—especially your focus on lesser-known cities. Let’s refine it.

#### Structure

- **Avoid fixed counts**: Four districts per city or six cities per major feels arbitrary. Instead, tie increments to your project’s flow:
    - **Districts**: Small updates or patches (e.g., bug fixes).
    - **Cities**: Minor milestones (e.g., new features).
    - **Regions or themes**: Major shifts (e.g., breaking changes).
- **Flexibility**: Let milestones, not numbers, guide when you switch.

#### Format Options

- **`##.{city}.{district}`** (e.g., `001.Bengaluru.Indiranagar`): Granular and full of local charm.
- **`##.{country}.{city}`** (e.g., `001.India.Bengaluru`): Broader and great for regional diversity.
- **Periodic Table** (e.g., `001.Noble_gas.Argon`): Clean, scientific, and scalable—tie elements to release vibes (e.g., `Carbon` for stability).

#### City Selection

- **Less obvious cities**: Brilliant! Using 3rd or 4th-tier cities (or hidden gems) keeps it fresh and avoids the “overdone” vibe of capitals. It could even become a team talking point.

#### Which to Pick?

- **Districts**: Ideal for frequent, colorful releases.
- **Countries + Cities**: Better for bigger, less frequent jumps.
- **Periodic Table**: Perfect if you want a universal, abstract theme.

#### Verdict

Start with `##.{city}.{district}` for its granularity and vibe. If it feels too detailed, try `##.{country}.{city}` or the Periodic Table. Base increments on milestones, and keep those lesser-known cities coming—they’re a highlight!

### D. Formatting and Separators

You’re leaning toward `Rio_de_Janeiro`-style formatting, and I’m here for it—it’s natural and readable. Let’s lock it in.

#### Formatting

- **`Rio_de_Janeiro`**: Winner—clear, familiar, and not overly tech-y.
- **`NewYork.LowerEastSide`**: Okay, but dots might confuse tools.
- **`new_york.lower_east_side`**: Functional but less elegant.

#### Separators

- **Dots** (e.g., `005.Rio_de_Janeiro.Praça_da_Bandeira`): Simple and hierarchical, but dots can clash with file paths or module names.
- **Triple underscores** (e.g., `005___Rio_de_Janeiro___Praça_da_Bandeira`): Distinctive but noisy and over the top.
- **Triple hyphens** (e.g., `005---Rio_de_Janeiro---Praça_da_Bandeira`): Same problem, just messier.

#### Better Option

- **Single underscores** (e.g., `005_Rio_de_Janeiro_Praça_da_Bandeira`): Clean, safe, and readable—avoids dot-related risks.

#### Special Characters

- **Accents** (e.g., `São_Paulo`, `Beyoncé_Ville`): JSON handles them, but some tools (logs, file systems) might choke.
- **Safe approach**: Use accents for human-facing stuff; normalize to ASCII (e.g., `Sao_Paulo`) for machine-facing processes if needed. Test it out!

#### Verdict

Go with `005_Rio_de_Janeiro_Praça_da_Bandeira` using single underscores. Keep accents if they fit the vibe, but be ready to sanitize if tools complain.

### E. Validators, Generators, and Documentation

You’re wondering about structure—validators, sorting, and registries. You’re on the right track!

- **Validator/Generator**: Build a simple CLI (e.g., `npx codename next`) to suggest labels, enforce rules, and check duplicates. It’s not overkill—it’s key to consistency. Hook it into CI or pre-commit for extra polish.
- **Sorting**: Use triple-padded numbers (e.g., `001`, `002`) to future-proof sorting up to 999 releases. It’s a small effort with big payoff.
- **Documentation**: Keep a `codenames.json` registry of cities and districts to avoid overlap and add context. Metadata (population, timezone) is optional—add it if it’s useful or fun, but keep it lean otherwise.

#### Verdict

Build that CLI, pad numbers to `001`, and start a registry. Metadata’s up to you—just don’t bog it down unless it adds value.

### F. Can This Work?

**Absolutely, yes!** You’re crafting something unique and workable. Here’s your blueprint:

#### Versioning

- `"version": "0.0.0-ver.0"` (or bump SemVer as needed).
- `"ver": "005_Rio_de_Janeiro_Praça_da_Bandeira"` for the expressive stuff.

#### Config

- Use JSONC with a preinstall script to generate `package.json`.

#### Naming

- `001_Rio_de_Janeiro_Praça_da_Bandeira` with single underscores.
- Districts for patches, cities for minors, regions/themes for majors.

#### Tools

- CLI validator and `codenames.json` registry.

#### What to Keep

- **Creativity**: Districts, custom `"ver"`, padded numbers.
- **Vibe**: Lesser-known cities, natural formatting.

#### What to Change

- Drop fixed counts (e.g., four districts)—let milestones drive it.

#### Be Careful About

- **Non-ASCII compatibility**: Test emojis and accents early.
- **Preinstall script**: Verify it in CI.

Start small: sandbox a few versions, test your pipeline, and tweak as you go. You’ll end up with a system that’s expressive, thematic, and yours—without breaking the tools you rely on.

**Final Tip**: Document it all in a `README.md` or `DOCTRINE.md` so your team (and future you) can follow along. This isn’t just versioning—it’s a narrative for your project. Keep it fun and meaningful, and let me know how it turns out!

## 🤖 Qwen

Based on your updated file and the provided context, here’s a distilled, actionable synthesis of your ideas and how to implement them effectively:

### **1. Versioning: Dual-Field Strategy**

- **Problem**: SemVer constraints limit expressiveness but are required for tooling compatibility.
- **Solution**:
    - Use a dummy `"version"` field (e.g., `"0.0.0-ver.0"`) to satisfy package managers.
    - Store your expressive version in a custom field like `"label"` (e.g., `"label": "déjà-vu_v2🔥"` or `"label": "005.Bengaluru.Koramangala"`).
- **Risks & Mitigations**:
    - **Tool Compatibility**: Ensure tools like `pnpm` and CI/CD pipelines ignore non-standard fields. Test with `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` to confirm stability.
    - **Non-ASCII Characters**: Use accents/emojis in `"label"` for human-facing outputs (e.g., changelogs), but normalize to ASCII for machine-facing processes (e.g., logs, APIs) to avoid parsing issues.

### **2. Config Format: JSONC with Preprocessing**

- **Problem**: JSON lacks comments and flexibility, but tools like `pnpm` require strict JSON.
- **Solution**:
    - Use **JSONC** (JSON with Comments) as the source format for `package.jsonc`.
    - Add a `preinstall` script to convert JSONC to plain JSON:
        ```json
        "scripts": {
          "preinstall": "jsonc -o package.json package.jsonc"
        }
        ```
- **Why JSONC Over JSON5**:
    - Simpler syntax (only adds comments).
    - Better IDE support (VS Code, etc.).
    - Avoids edge cases from JSON5 features (e.g., unquoted keys).

### **3. Thematic Naming: Structured Hierarchy**

- **Problem**: Arbitrary numbering (e.g., "four districts per city") feels rigid.
- **Solution**: Tie naming to milestones:
    - **Major Version**: New theme (e.g., switching from geography to the periodic table).
    - **Minor Version**: New city or IUPAC group (e.g., `"001.Bengaluru"` or `"001.Noble_gas.Argon"`).
    - **Patch Version**: District or element isotope (e.g., `"001.Bengaluru.Indiranagar"` or `"001.Noble_gas.Argon.Isotope_40"`).
- **City Selection**: Prioritize underused, culturally rich cities (e.g., Kochi over Delhi) or periodic table elements for uniqueness.

### **4. Formatting & Syntax**

- **Structure**: Use `###.{Primary}.{Secondary}` (e.g., `005.Bengaluru.Indiranagar`).
- **Separators**:
    - Use dots (`.`) for hierarchy (tool-safe and intuitive).
    - Avoid triple separators (`___`/`---`) for simplicity.
- **Casing**: Use `Title_Case_With_Underscores` (e.g., `Rio_de_Janeiro`) for readability.
- **Special Characters**:
    - Allow accents in `"label"` (e.g., `São_Paulo`) but normalize to ASCII (e.g., `Sao_Paulo`) for machine use.
    - Emojis (e.g., `🔥`) are safe in human-facing contexts but avoid in code/tooling paths.

### **5. Tooling & Automation**

- **Validator/Generator CLI**:
    - Enforce naming rules (e.g., `validate-label "005.Bengaluru.Indiranagar"`).
    - Auto-suggest next labels (e.g., `npx codename next --minor` → `"006.Bengaluru.Jayanagar"`).
- **Registry**: Maintain a `codenames.json` file to track used names and metadata (e.g., city timezone, element atomic weight).
- **Padding**: Use triple digits (e.g., `005`) for natural sorting up to 999 releases.

### **6. Risk Mitigation**

- **Test Dummy Versions**: Validate `"version": "0.0.0-ver.0"` in CI with `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`.
- **ASCII Fallback**: Use libraries like `unorm` or `transliteration` to sanitize labels in pipelines.
- **Documentation**: Explain themes/labels in `DOCTRINE.md` to ensure team alignment.

### **Final Recommendations**

1. **Start Small**:
    - Implement JSONC and the dual-version strategy first.
    - Gradually add tooling (validator, registry) as the system scales.
2. **Balance Creativity & Compatibility**:
    - Keep SemVer intact for tooling.
    - Use `"label"` for human-centric expressiveness.
3. **Future-Proof**:
    - Avoid hard limits (e.g., "four districts per city").
    - Tie versioning to milestones, not arbitrary numbers.

Your approach is innovative and viable. By decoupling tooling requirements from human-readable expressiveness, you create a system that is both robust and memorable. 🚀
