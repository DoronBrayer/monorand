# Defect elimination

This is the disciplined process of tracing, resolving, and validating the removal of bad behavior or undesirable portion — not only bugs. Hence, _Defect elimination_.

## Defect statement

Describe the observed issue:

- Steps to reproduce
- Environment and context (OS, version, configuration)
- Links to error logs or screenshots

## Root Cause Analysis (RCA)

Analyze the fault:

- Code location and failure mode
- Underlying cause (e.g., logic error, race condition)

## Elimination strategy

Outline your remediation plan:

- Code changes or refactoring steps
- Regression prevention measures
- Dependency or configuration updates

## Verification plan

Confirm the defect is resolved:

- Tests added or modified
- Manual test scenarios
- Metrics or performance checks

## Checklist

- [ ] Tests validate the fix
- [ ] All CI checks are passing
- [ ] Documentation updated to reflect corrected behavior
- [ ] No unintended side effects introduced
