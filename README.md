# `shuffrand` by Doron B.
**shuff**le‚Ää+‚Ää**rand**om‚Ää=‚Ääshuffrand. This perfectly encapsulates the library‚Äôs initial core functionalities:

üé≤‚ÄäCryptographically secure randomness and shuffling‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwith **soul**.

<small>_cryptoString (cryptographically secure string) was actually added later in the project‚Äôs development._</small>
## Features
‚úîÔ∏è **Cryptographically secure RNG**: leverages `globalThis.crypto.getRandomValues()` (CSPRNG) for **truly** unpredictable numbers.<br>
‚úîÔ∏è **Precise number generation**: generates integers and doubles with configurable bounds, fractional digits, and advanced exclusion logic (`none`, `lower bound`, `upper bound`, `both`).<br>
‚úîÔ∏è **Secure Fisher‚ÄìYates shuffle**: implements the industry-standard Fisher‚ÄìYates algorithm for cryptographically strong array permutations.<br>
‚úîÔ∏è **Flexible shuffle modes**: supports both destructive (in-place) and non-destructive (returns a new array) shuffling.<br>
‚úîÔ∏è **`preventIdentical` option**: guarantees a different permutation for small arrays (with a clear statistical bias caveat for non-critical use).<br>
‚úîÔ∏è **Secure string generation**: creates random strings from predefined (`alphanumeric`, `numeric`, `hex`, etc.) or custom Unicode-aware character sets.<br>
‚úîÔ∏è **Entropy calculation**: provides a utility to quantify the cryptographic strength (bits of entropy) of generated strings.<br>
‚úîÔ∏è **Fully typed with TypeScript**: offers a superior developer experience with comprehensive type definitions for seamless integration.<br>
‚úîÔ∏è **Robust runtime validation**: utilizes ArkType for rigorous runtime input validation, enhancing reliability and preventing unexpected behavior.<br>
‚úîÔ∏è **ESM-first & Node.js v20+**: built with a future-forward architecture for optimal tree-shaking and modern environment compatibility.
## Installation
‚Ä¢ **pnpm**: `pnpm install shuffrand`<br>‚Ä¢ **npm**: `npm install shuffrand`<br>‚Ä¢ **Deno**: `import { cryptoRandom, cryptoShuffle, cryptoString } from "npm:shuffrand@1.2.3"`‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää<small>no dedicated `install`/`add` command</small><br>‚Ä¢ **Yarn**: `yarn add shuffrand`<br>‚Ä¢ **Bun**: `bun add shuffrand`
## Usage
Using `shuffrand` is straightforward, designed to be intuitive while providing powerful cryptographic capabilities.
### The trio
‚Ä¢ <small>cryptoRandom(‚Ää{‚Ää‚Ä¶‚Ää}‚Ää)<br>‚Ä¢ cryptoShuffle(‚Ää{‚Ää‚Ä¶‚Ää}‚Ää)<br>‚Ä¢ cryptoString(‚Ää{‚Ää‚Ä¶‚Ää}‚Ää)</small>

### Generating true random numbers via `cryptoRandom`
```js
import { cryptoRandom } from ‚Ää'shuffrand';

// Generate a random integer between 1 and 10 (inclusive)
const randomInt = cryptoRandom({ lowerBound: 1, upperBound: 10, typeOfNum: 'integer' });
console.log(`Random Integer: ${randomInt}`); // e.g., 7

// Generate a random double between 0 and 1 (exclusive of 1), with 5 fractional digits
const randomDouble = cryptoRandom({ lowerBound: 0, upperBound: 1, typeOfNum: 'double', maxFracDigits: 5 });
console.log(`Random Double: ${randomDouble}`); // e.g., 0.45678

// Generate a random integer from 5 to 10, excluding the lower bound (i.e., 6-10)
const randomIntExcludingLower = cryptoRandom({ lowerBound: 5, upperBound: 10, typeOfNum: 'integer', exclusion: 'lower bound' });
console.log(`Random Integer (excluding lower): ${randomIntExcludingLower}`); // e.g., 8
```
### Shuffling arrays via `cryptoShuffle`
```js
import { cryptoShuffle } from ‚Ää'shuffrand';

// Non-destructive shuffle (default behavior)
const originalArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const shuffledArray = cryptoShuffle(originalArray);
console.log(`Original Array: ${originalArray}`); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] (unchanged)
console.log(`Shuffled Array: ${shuffledArray}`); // e.g., [3, 1, 5, 2, 4] (new array)

// Destructive shuffle
const mutableArray = ['alpha', 'beta', 'gamma'];
cryptoShuffle(mutableArray, { isDestructive: true });
console.log(`Mutated Array: ${mutableArray}`); // e.g., ['gamma', 'alpha', 'beta'] (original array modified)

// Shuffle with preventIdentical (for small arrays where identical shuffles might annoy users)
const smallArray = ['A', 'B'];
const guaranteedDifferentShuffle = cryptoShuffle(smallArray, { preventIdentical: true });
console.log(`Guaranteed Different Shuffle: ${guaranteedDifferentShuffle}`); // Will always be ['B', 'A']
```
### Generating random strings via `cryptoString`
```js
import { cryptoString, calculateStringEntropy } from ‚Ää'shuffrand';

// Generate a 16-character alphanumeric string (default)
const token = cryptoString();
console.log(`Secure Token: ${token}`); // e.g., "aBc1XyZ7pQ2rS9tU"

// Generate a 10-digit numeric passcode
const passcode = cryptoString({ length: 6, characterSet: 'numeric' });
console.log(`Numeric Passcode: ${passcode}`); // e.g., "823019"

// Generate a string using a custom character set (e.g., emojis!)
const emojiSequence = cryptoString({ length: 5, characterSet: 'üòÄüòÇüòáüòà‚ú®' });
console.log(`Emoji Sequence: ${emojiSequence}`); // e.g., "üòá‚ú®üòÇüòÄüòà"

// Calculate the entropy of a generated string
const customCharset = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789'; // 36 unique characters
const entropy = calculateStringEntropy({ length: 20, characterSet: customCharset });
console.log(`Entropy of a 20-char string from this set: ${entropy.toFixed(2)} bits`); // e.g., 103.58 bits
```
### In the Browser (without a bundler)
You might be wondering "Why can‚Äôt I just use a simple `<script src="shuffrand.js"></script>` like I used to?" That‚Äôs a great question, and it gets to the heart of modern JavaScript.
`shuffrand` is built using **ES Modules** the modern standard for structuring JavaScript code. This gives you powerful benefits like:

‚Ä¢ **No global clutter**: Your code stays clean, without variables accidentally interfering with other scripts.<br>
‚Ä¢ **Efficiency**: Tools can "tree-shake" (remove unused code), making your final application smaller.<br>
‚Ä¢ **Clear dependencies**: It‚Äôs obvious what each part of the code needs from another.

Because `shuffrand` uses ES Modules (and internally relies on `arktype`, which also uses ES Modules), when you want to use it directly in a browser without a "bundler" (like Vite, Webpack, or Rollup, which are common in larger projects), the browser needs a little help.
This "help" comes in the form of an **Import Map**. Think of an Import Map as a simple lookup table in your HTML that tells the browser: "When you see an `import` statement for `shuffrand` (or `arktype`, or its internal parts), here‚Äôs the exact URL where you can find it on a CDN."
#### Why `arktype` isn‚Äôt embedded and the extra mappings are needed
`shuffrand` externalizes `arktype` to keep its own bundle size small (~50‚ÄäkB) and prevent duplicate code in your final application if you use `arktype` elsewhere. Because `arktype` itself is a complex monorepo with internal ES Module imports (like `@ark/schema` and `@ark/util`), the browser‚Äôs `importmap` needs explicit entries for these sub-dependencies to resolve them correctly from `esm.sh`.
Important note on local files (CORS): If you open your HTML file directly from your computer‚Äôs file system (e.g., by double-clicking it, resulting in a `file:///‚Ä¶` address in your browser), browsers will block external resources from CDNs due to security rules (CORS). To avoid this, you need to serve your HTML file using a simple local web server.
#### The easiest way to serve locally (no Node.js project needed)
Open your terminal (command line interface).
Navigate to the directory containing your HTML file.
Run this command: `python -m http.server 8000` (If `python` doesn‚Äôt work, try `py -m http.server 8000` or search for "simple http server python" for alternatives).
Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8000/your-file.html`.
#### HTML example for direct browser use
Here‚Äôs a full `index.html` example you can use. Copy and paste this entire code into your HTML file, serve it with the simple Python server, and check your browser‚Äôs console (usually F12) for the output.
(Note: The JavaScript code in the `<script type="module">` block below can, and often should, be placed in a separate `.js` file (e.g., `main.js`) and imported via `<script type="module" src="./main.js"></script>` for better code organization. This example keeps it inline for simplicity.)

        // --- Usage Examples ---

        // 1. Generating true random numbers via cryptoRandom
        const randomInt = cryptoRandom({ lowerBound: 1, upperBound: 10, typeOfNum: 'integer' });
        console.log(`Random Integer: ${randomInt}`);

#### Further clarifications (FYI)
‚Ä¢ **Why not just a simple `<script src="‚Ä¶"></script>`**? Modern JavaScript libraries like `shuffrand` use ES Modules for better organization, efficiency (e.g., "tree-shaking" to remove unused code), and to avoid polluting the global scope. This module system requires a specific loading mechanism, which the `importmap` provides for direct browser use.<br>
‚Ä¢ **Is this ‚Äúthe way to go‚Äù?** Yes, using ES Modules with an `importmap` is a modern and proper W3C standard for direct browser loading. For larger applications, developers commonly use bundlers (like Vite or Webpack) which automate this dependency resolution, but the underlying principles are the same.

Moving on‚Ä¶<br>If you‚Äôre building applications where **true** unpredictability, fairness, and security are non-negotiable, you've found your essential utility. We believe that in today‚Äôs digital landscape, the integrity of your random data is paramount, and `shuffrand` is built to meet that challenge without compromise.

At its core, `shuffrand` offers a lean yet powerful API. Our `cryptoRandom` function generates secure numbers (integers or doubles) with precise control over ranges and exclusions, while `cryptoShuffle` provides cryptographically strong array permutations, either destructively or non-destructively. Need secure identifiers? `cryptoString` crafts random strings from various character sets, including Unicode, and even helps you calculate their cryptographic entropy.

This entire library is built with a future-forward mindset: it‚Äôs ESM-first, TypeScript-native, and optimized for Node.js v20+, ensuring a modern, maintainable, and tree-shakable solution that aligns with contemporary JavaScript development.

What truly sets `shuffrand` apart is its unwavering commitment to quality. Every line of code is subjected to rigorous testing (Vitest), not just against its source, but against the final compiled JavaScript files that get shipped to npm. This "test the final product" philosophy, coupled with robust runtime input validation via [ArkType](https://arktype.io/), ensures an exceptionally dependable utility. Whether you‚Äôre generating secure tokens for authentication, ensuring fair play in a gaming application, conducting unbiased statistical simulations, or simply need truly unpredictable data, `shuffrand` provides the secure foundation you can trust.
## Practical applications
`shuffrand` isn‚Äôt just about theoretical cryptographic purity; it‚Äôs a powerful **utility** designed for real-world scenarios where **unpredictable** and **unbiased** randomness is paramount. Here are just a few areas where `shuffrand` becomes an **indispensable** tool:

### [01] Security & auth
‚Ä¢ **Secure identifiers and tokens**: generate cryptographically strong **UUIDs**, session **tokens**, and unique **identifiers** for users, transactions, or resources. This is crucial for preventing brute-force attacks and ensuring **access** control.<br>
‚Ä¢ **Cryptographic keys and salts**: while `shuffrand` doesn‚Äôt perform **encryption** or **decryption** directly, it provides the high-quality **randomness** needed to generate robust **keys** and **salts** for **hashing** algorithms, significantly enhancing security.<br>
‚Ä¢ **Data masking**: create random, yet consistent, masked data for testing or development environments, ensuring sensitive information remains secure while maintaining data structure.
### [02] Gaming and simulations (TTRPG, D&D, etc.)
‚Ä¢ **Fair play mechanics**: implement truly **fair** game mechanics, from **coin-flips** and **dice rolls** (think `d20` for **D&D** and **TTRPGs**) to shuffling virtual card decks in games like **Hearthstone**. This ensures a genuinely **probabilistic** and **unbiased** experience for players.<br>
‚Ä¢ **Critical hits and chance events**: accurately model chance-based events, such as **critical-hit** probabilities or loot drops, ensuring the underlying **algorithm** is sound and **unpredictable**.<br>
‚Ä¢ **Lottery and prize draws**: for applications requiring verifiable fairness, `shuffrand` can be the **generator** for **lottery** numbers or prize draw selections.
### [03] Data processing and automation
‚Ä¢ **Randomized data samples**: select random subsets from large datasets for statistical analysis or **mock-data** generation.<br>
‚Ä¢ **Array permutations**: efficiently **shuffle** or **scramble** arrays of any type, whether for presenting randomized content, creating survey variations, or processing data in a **nondestructive** or **in-place** (destructive) manner.<br>
‚Ä¢ **Automation**: integrate **randomness** into **automation** scripts where variability is needed, such as randomized delays or orderings.
### [04] Scientific and probabilistic research
‚Ä¢ **Statistical simulations**: conduct simulations that require genuinely **unbiased** random inputs to ensure the validity of results.<br>
‚Ä¢ **Entropy measurement**: use `calculateStringEntropy` to quantify the strength of generated random strings, aiding in security audits and compliance.
## Mock it till you make it.
In the grand scheme of things, `shuffrand` is a lightweight chassis for those **synthetic data makers**‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääor whatever they‚Äôre called‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääfloating around GitHub.

This ambitious endeavor will heavily rely on `shuffrand`‚Äôs robust and secure primitives to generate:

‚Ä¢ **Secure UUIDs**: universally Unique Identifiers that are **truly** random and collision-resistant.<br>
‚Ä¢ **Passcodes**: strong, unpredictable passcodes for various authentication and authorization needs.<br>
‚Ä¢ **Other unique identifiers**: a broad spectrum of secure and unique identifiers for diverse application requirements.

The design principles guiding this balance are clear:<br>remain **focused** and provide **only the core** stuff. This ensures a **building block**, rather than a bloated lib with specialized features.
