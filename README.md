**This is a monorepo** (short for _monolithic repository_) — a single megaproject that holds several libraries/packages — all in one big place. Instead of splitting each into separate repositories (like we used to do in the 2010s), everything lives together, making it easier to share code, manage tools, and coordinate alterations across the system.

Picture it like a house…<br>
The monorepo is the whole structure, and each library/package is a **room** inside — kitchen, bathroom, laundry, etc. — each has its own function, but they share the same walls, plumbing, and electricity. That shared foundation makes development smoother and more efficient.
