# datrand<br><small>Synthetic data weaver — with **soul**.</small>
`datrand` is a **fully-typed, heavily-tested synthetic data weaver** — weaving everything from believable entries (step aside, John Doe!) to cryptographically-secure secrets, while closing the gap where traditional faker tools skimp on high entropy or type-safety. Built to eliminate the drudgery of hand-rolling mocks and the compliance risks of real-world data, it leverages `shuffrand`’s CSPRNG engine for **hyper-polished outputs that feel authentic yet stay fabricated**. For backend engineers immersing fingers into greasy DBs, automation specialists dripping sweat over JSON schemas, or frontend devs pouring tears onto graphical interfaces—`datrand` thrives in these envs — delivering realism without risk, quietly and reliably, exactly the way you want it.

#### Etymology
data + randomization = datrand
