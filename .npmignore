# .NPMIGNORE — skipping files, dirs, and patterns
# This file is now very simple because 'package.json’s "files" array
# explicitly lists what to include, while this one lists what to EXCLUDE.

# --- Common temporary/system files (not controlled by "files" array) ---
*.log
*.env
.env.*
npm-debug.log*
yarn-error.log*
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
*.lnk

# --- Editor-specific configurations (often ignored regardless of "files") ---
.vscode/

# --- Git-related files (often ignored regardless of "files") ---
.git/
.gitignore
.gitattributes

# --- GitHub-specific directories and CI/CD workflows (for repo only, not package) ---
.github/

# --- pnpm specific files (not needed in published package) ---
pnpm-lock.yaml

# --- Development-only directories ---
reports/
test-result*/

# --- Internal Inspection & Tooling (not to be confused with testing!) ---
